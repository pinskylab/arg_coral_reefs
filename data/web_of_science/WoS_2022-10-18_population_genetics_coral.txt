The availability of polymorphic DNA markers in P. damicornis can act as impetus for investigations into inheritance and population genetics, as well as novel investigations into host-symbiont ecology and evolution. Coral bleaching and gene flow studies performed with these markers can have direct conservation implications.

Population genetic analyses using DNA markers have provided useful information on how coral populations are maintained. In this chapter, I briefly introduce the history of using DNA markers in the population genetic analyses of corals. I also explain the merit of population genetic analyses to delineate the species boundaries of corals and infer how reproductive characteristics contribute to connectivity among populations. Based on previous studies on population genetic analyses of corals, I also discuss how population genetic analyses have contributed toward understanding the patterns of connectivity among coral populations and geographic variations in genetic diversity, primarily focusing on examples along the Ryukyu Archipelago. Finally, I propose future directions for the population genetics of corals in Japan, taking several aspects into consideration, including methodological information, such as seascape genetics and the development of novel molecular markers for utilizing next-generation sequencing technologies.

Genetic differentiation in the threatened soft coral Dendronephthya australis in temperate eastern Australia	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						cauliflower soft coral; endangered species; PCR sequencing; population genetics; SNP genotyping	R PACKAGE; POPULATION-GENETICS; ANTHOZOA; GENUS; REPRODUCTION; OCTOCORALLIA; SARCOPHYTON; RECRUITMENT; COMPETITION; DIVERSITY	The endangered soft coral Dendronephthya australis faces substantial population decreases in central eastern Australian waters. Despite uncertainty about the cause of these declines, the population genetics of the species has not been investigated. Genetic analysis suggests that D. australis is a single species within the family Nephtheidae, confirming identifications based on morphological characteristics only. Soft coral colonies were distributed from Seahorse Gardens in Port Stephens to Jervis Bay in temperate Australian waters, a distance of some 400 km. Genetic differentiation was observed along this distribution using SNP genotyping. Relatively high levels of genetic differentiation were observed between Jervis Bay and the other sites, indicating limited gene flow between this location and others. Moreover, the genetic distinctiveness, low diversity and heterozygote excess at this southern location suggested that it was subjected to a recent population decline and genetic bottleneck. Colonies at Seahorse Gardens and Ettalong, approximately 150 km south of Seahorse Gardens, displayed greater genetic diversity, making these sites more likely to host ancestral populations and to have acted as refugia. Recent substantial decreases in population sizes at these locations are particularly concerning, and these locations require immediate conservation attention.

Molecular phylogenetic studies have suggested that A. tenuis belongs to the most basal Glade (Glade I) while A. digitifera belongs to a derived Glade (Glade IV). In order to develop microsatellite markers that would be useful for most Acropora species, we sequenced the genomic DNA of A. tenuis, using a next generation sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and designed primer sets that amplify microsatellite loci. Afterward we selected primer pairs with perfectly matched nucleotide sequences from which at least one primer was uniquely mapped to the A. digitifera genome. Fourteen microsatellite markers showed non-significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in both A. tenuis and A. digitifera. Thus these markers could be used for wide range of species and may provide powerful tools for population genetics studies and conservation of Acropora corals.

All loci are polymorphic with allele numbers ranging from five to 31 and observed heterozygosities from 0.17 to 0.89. These loci can be used in assessing gene flow patterns and diversity of this stony coral species both for local coral reef management purposes as well as for elucidating population connectivity within the greater Caribbean basin. These markers should also be applicable to other species of Montastraea and for resolving taxonomic relationships within the M. annularis species complex.

Symbiodinium glynnii sp nov., a species of stress-tolerant symbiotic dinoflagellates from pocilloporid and montiporid corals in the Pacific Ocean	PHYCOLOGIA			English	Article						Climate change; Dinoflagellates; Machine learning; Pocillopora; Population genetics; Taxonomy; 'Zooxanthellae'	CLADE-D SYMBIODINIUM; GENUS SYMBIODINIUM; REEF CORAL; EASTERN PACIFIC; POPULATION-GENETICS; MICROSATELLITE LOCI; DIVERSITY; HOST; ENDOSYMBIONTS; SPECIFICITY	A formal Symbiodinium species taxonomy enhances understanding of the physiology and ecology of coral-dinoflagellate symbioses. Here we formally define a new species of stress tolerant Symbiodinium in Clade D, Symbiodinium glynnii sp. nov. This species exhibits high host specificity for members of the stony coral genus Pocillopora in the Pacific Ocean and can also be found in symbiosis with the coral genera Seriatopora and Montipora. Symbiodinium glynnii is especially common in the Eastern Tropical and subtropical Pacific, where Pocillopora is abundant and ecologically important. While S. glynnii is evolutionarily closely related to Symbiodinium trenchii, a combination of multilocus genetic data including rDNA, chloroplast (psbA), and single copy nuclear microsatellites, as well as differences in ecology (host associations), morphology (cell size), and ultrastructure (chromosome size), identify S. glynnii as distinct from S. trenchii and other Clade D species. Finally we use these data to parameterize a provisional classification and regression model to show how closely related species are recognized by integrating multiple sources of evidence.

Isolation and characterization of microsatellite loci in Aspergillus sydowii, a pathogen of Caribbean sea fan corals	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES			English	Article						coral disease; fungal pathogen; Gorgonia ventalina; gorgonian coral; population genetics		Here we report on nine microsatellite loci designed for Aspergillus sydowii, a widely distributed soil saprobe that is also the pathogenic agent of aspergillosis in Caribbean sea fan corals. Primers were tested on 20 A. sydowii isolates from the Caribbean, 17 from diseased sea fans and three from environmental sources. All loci were polymorphic and exhibited varying degrees of allelic diversity (three to nine alleles). Gene diversity (expected heterozygosity) ranged from 0.353 to 0.821. These primers will enable future research into the epidemiology of A. sydowii as an emergent infectious disease.

We found 27 microsatellites across both species, although only five loci were polymorphic in each species. Microsatellite loci displayed a wide range of diversity levels with four to 11 alleles per locus (H-O = 0.26-0.91) in P. daedalea and two to seven alleles per locus (H-O = 0.16-0.96) in G. favulus. Most loci showed departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium which may reflect nonrandom mating but may also be related to difficulties associated with coral DNA.

Since they are highly fecund predators of corals, periodic outbreaks of COTS cause substantial loss of healthy coral reefs. Using complete mitochondrial DNA sequences, we here examined how COTS outbreaks in the Ryukyu Archipelago, Japan are reflected by the profile of their population genetics. Population genetics of the blue starfish,Linckia laevigata, which lives in the Ryukyu Archipelago, but not break out and the northern Pacific sea star,Asterias amurensis, which lives in colder seawater around the main Islands of Japan, were also examined as controls. Our results showed thatAs. amurensishas at least two local populations that diverged approximately 4.7 million years ago (MYA), and no genetic exchanges have occurred between the populations since then.Linckia laevigatashows two major populations in the Ryukyu Archipelago that likely diverged similar to 6.8 MYA. The two populations, each comprised of individuals collected from coast of the Okinawa Island and those from the Ishigaki Island, suggest the presence of two cryptic species in the Ryukyu Archipelago. On the other hand, population genetics of COTS showed a profile quite different from those ofAsteriasandLinckia. At least five lineages of COTS have arisen since their divergence similar to 0.7 MYA, and each of the lineages is present at the Okinawa Island, Miyako Island, and Ishigaki Island. These results suggest that COTS have experienced repeated genetic bottlenecks that may be associated with or caused by repeated outbreaks.

In contrast to other animals, trinucleotide repeats, rather than dinucleotide repeats, are dominant in the WGS-SSRs, and AAT is the most frequent trinucleotide motif in EST-SSRs. We successfully developed 40 polymorphic markers from EST-SSRs and WGS-SSRs. Both EST- and WGS-SSRs show high levels of polymorphism within corals from the same reef patch. Interestingly, markers WGS079 and WGS227 revealed SSR duplications in a few individuals, suggesting recent duplication events. Genotypic linkage disequilibrium was identified in 5 pairs of SSR markers, which will be invaluable for high-resolution studies of genetic admixture in natural populations of A. millepora. Transferability analysis showed that 25 of these markers can be successfully amplified in one of the most ubiquitous Indo-Pacific corals Acropora hyacinthus. The marker collection reported here is the largest ever developed for any reef-building coral. It holds great potential for addressing coral reef connectivity across the Indo-Pacific with an unprecedented precision, especially taking into account the cross-species transferability of a substantial number of markers.

Reef connectivity analyses have been highlighted as one of the major future research avenues necessary for implementing effective management initiatives for coral reefs. Despite the number of new molecular genetic tools and the wealth of information that is now available for population-level processes in many marine disciplines, scleractinian coral population genetic information remains surprisingly limited. Here we examine the technical problems and approaches used, address the reasons contributing to this delay in understanding, and discuss the future of coral population marker development. Considerable resources are needed to target the immediate development of an array of relevant genetic markers coupled with the rapid production of management focused data in order to help conserve our globally threatened coral reef resources.

While abundances of other species have declined, however, the relative abundance of the mustard hill coral, Porites astreoides, has increased. Porites astreoides is relatively resilient to some stressors, and because of its mixed reproductive strategies, its populations often recover quickly following disturbances. The ability for P. astreoides to continue as a potential "winner" in western Atlantic reefs relies on maintaining sufficient genetic variation within populations to support acclimatization and adaptation to current and future environmental change. Without high genetic diversity and gene flow within the population, it would have limited capacity for adaptation and the species' competitive advantages could be short-lived. In this study, we determined the genetic relatedness of 37 P. astreoides colonies at four shallow reefs along the offshore Florida Keys Reef Tract (FKRT), a region particularly hard-hit by recent disturbances. Using previously designed microsatellite markers, we determined the genetic diversity and connectivity of individuals among and between sites. Our results suggest that the FKRT likely contains a single, well-mixed genetic population of P. astreoides, with high levels of gene flow and evidence for larval migration throughout the region. This suggests that regional populations of P. astreoides likely have a higher chance of maintaining resilience than many other western Atlantic species as they face current and future disturbances.

Management and conservation of this species requires a better understanding of the genetic structuring and connectivity among populations. With this aim, seven microsatellite loci have been isolated. All loci were polymorphic with allele numbers ranging from five to 26 and observed heterozygosity ranging from 0.18 to 0.68. Significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg expected genotype frequencies due to heterozygote deficiency were detected at all loci.

Isolation, characterization and cross amplification of eleven novel microsatellite loci for the hydrozoan coral Millepora	CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES			English	Article						Genetic diversity; Microsatellites; Milleporidae; Population genetics; Reef-building cnidarians		Milleporidae are of high ecological and economic importance, as, together with the scleractinian corals, they belong to the main reef builders of tropical coral reefs. Coral reefs face severe threats mainly due to anthropogenic disturbance. Understanding their population structure and dynamics is crucial for any conservation effort. Here we report the first microsatellite loci for the Milleporidae. Eleven polymorphic markers were developed for the hydrozoan corals Millepora dichotoma from the Great Barrier Reef (Australia) and tested for amplification in M. dichotoma from the Red Sea (Egypt), as well as for Millepora platyphylla from the Pacific Ocean (Moorea, French Polynesia). All loci were variable with 4-15 alleles per locus. Nine loci were transferable between geographic regions and species. These are the first microsatellites for hydrozoan corals. They will provide valuable tools for characterizing the population structure and genetic diversity of the group thereby benefitting coral reef conservation.

Characterization and cross-amplification of microsatellite markers in four species of anemonefish (Pomacentridae, Amphiprion spp.)	MARINE BIODIVERSITY			English	Article						Amphiprion; Clownfish; Coral reefs; Microsatellite; Population genetics	CORAL-REEF FISH; GENETIC POPULATION-STRUCTURE; CONNECTIVITY; PATTERNS; METAPOPULATION; REPLENISHMENT; RECRUITMENT; PERSISTENCE; NETWORK; SEA	Anemonefish are iconic symbols of coral reefs and have become model systems for research on larval dispersal and population connectivity in coral reef fishes. Here we present 24 novel microsatellite markers across four species of anemonefish and also test 35 previously published markers for cross-amplification on two anemonefish species in order to facilitate further research on their population genetics and phylogenetics. Novel loci were isolated from sequences derived from microsatellite-enriched or 454 GS-FLX shotgun sequence libraries developed using congeneric DNA. Primer testing successfully identified 15 new microsatellite loci for A. percula, 4 for A. melanopus, 3 for A. akindynos, and 2 for A. omanensis. These novel microsatellite loci were polymorphic with a mean of 10 +/- 1.6 SE (standard error) alleles per locus and an average observed heterozygosity of 0.647 +/- 0.032 SE. Reliable cross-amplification of 12 and 26 of the 35 previously published Amphiprion markers was achieved for A. melanopus and A. akindynos, respectively, suggesting that the use of markers developed from the DNA of congeners can provide a quick and cost-effective alternative to the isolation of new loci. Together, the markers presented here provide an important resource for ecological, evolutionary, and conservation genetic research on anemonefishes that will inform broader conservation and management actions for coral reef fishes.

We screened 29 polymorphic loci in individuals from Reserva de la Bisfera Banco Chinchorro (RBBC), Quintana Roo, Mexico to assess variability. Number of alleles per locus varied from 8 to 20, observed and expected heterozygosities from 0.458 to 1.00 and from 0.820 to 0.931, respectively. Some of the primers amplified individuals of four congeneric species. These markers will constitute invaluable tools for elucidating patterns of connectivity among populations of coral reef fishes, providing important information for the conservation of coral reefs.

Mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence data are not an improvement for species identification in scleractinian corals	PEERJ			English	Article						Coral; Barcoding; Mitochondrial DNA; Species	MONTIPORA-CAPITATA; EVOLUTION; OCTOCORAL	There are well-known difficulties in using the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) mitochondrial gene region for population genetics and DNA barcoding in corals. A recent study of species divergence in the endemic Caribbean genus Agaricia reinforced such knowledge. However, the growing availability of whole mitochondrial genomes may help indicate more promising gene regions for species delineation. I assembled the whole mitochondrial genome for Agaricia fragilis from Illumina single-end 250 bp reads and compared this sequence to that of the congener A. humilis. Although these data suggest that the cytochrome b (CYB) gene region is more promising, comparison of available CYB sequence data from scleractinian and other reef-building corals indicates that multilocus approaches are still probably necessary for phylogenetic and population genetic analysis of recently-diverged coral taxa.

J	Santos, SR				Santos, Scott R.			Expanding the population genetic perspective of cnidarian-Symbiodinium symbioses	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Editorial Material						Acropora; cnidarian; coral reef; population genetics; Symbiodinium	CORAL; REEF; SPECIFICITY; LIGHT	The modern synthesis was a seminal period in the biological sciences, establishing many of the core principles of evolutionary biology that we know today. Significant catalysts were the contributions of R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright (and others) developing the theoretical underpinning of population genetics, thus demonstrating adaptive evolution resulted from the interplay of forces such as natural selection and mutation within groups of individuals occupying the same space and time (i. e. a population). Given its importance, it is surprising that detailed population genetic data remain lacking for numerous organisms vital to many ecosystems. For example, the coral reef ecosystem is well recognized for its high biodiversity and productivity, numerous ecological services and significant economic and societal values (Moberg & Folke 1999; Cinner 2014). Many coral reef invertebrates form symbiotic relationships with single-celled dinoflagellates within the genus Symbiodinium Freudenthal (Taylor 1974), with hosts providing these (typically) intracellular symbionts with by-products of metabolism and in turn receiving photosynthetically fixed carbon capable of meeting hosts' respiratory demands (Falkowski et al. 1984; Muscatine et al. 1984). Unfortunately, the health and integrity of the coral reef ecosystem has been significantly and negatively impacted by onslaughts like anthropogenic eutrophication and disease in addition to global climate change, with increased incidences of 'bleaching' events (characterized as the loss of photosynthetic pigments from the algal cell or massive reduction of Symbiodinium density from hosts' tissue) and host mortality leading to staggering declines in geographic coverage (Bruno & Selig 2007) that have raised questions on the viability of this ecosystem as we know it (Bellwood et al. 2004; Parmesan 2006). One avenue towards anticipating the future of the coral reef ecosystem is by developing a broader and deeper understanding of the current genotypic diversity encompassed within and between populations of their keystone species, the scleractinian corals and dinoflagellate symbionts, as they potentially possess functional variation (either singularly or in combination) that may come under selection due to the ongoing and rapid environmental changes they are experiencing. However, such studies, especially for members of the genus Symbiodinium, are sparse. In this issue, Baums et al. (2014) provide a significant contribution by documenting the range-wide population genetics of Symbiodinium 'fitti' (Fig. 1) in the context of complementary data from its host, the endangered Caribbean elkhorn coral Acropora palmata (Fig. 2). Notable results of this study include a single S. 'fitti' genotype typically dominates an individual A. palmata colony both spatially and temporally, gene flow among coral host populations is a magnitude higher to that of its symbiont populations, and the partners possess disparate patterns of genetic differentiation across the Greater Caribbean. The implications of such findings are discussed herein.

Unexpected cryptic species diversity in the widespread coral Seriatoporahystrix masks spatial-genetic patterns of connectivity	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						connectivity; coral; cryptic species; population genetics; Seriatopora	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; MONTASTRAEA-ANNULARIS; GENOTYPIC DIVERSITY; POPULATION-GENETICS; BROODING CORAL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISTANCE; DELIMITATION; HYSTRIX; FLOW	Mounting evidence of cryptic species in a wide range of taxa highlights the need for careful analyses of population genetic data sets to unravel within-species diversity from potential interspecies relationships. Here, we use microsatellite loci and hierarchical clustering analysis to investigate cryptic diversity in sympatric and allopatric (separated by 450km) populations of the widespread coral Seriatoporahystrix on the Great Barrier Reef. Structure analyses delimited unique genetic clusters that were confirmed by phylogenetic and extensive population-level analyses. Each of four sympatric yet distinct genetic clusters detected within S.hystrix demonstrated greater genetic cohesion across regional scales than between genetic clusters within regions (<10km). Moreover, the magnitude of genetic differentiation between different clusters (>0.620G(ST)) was similar to the difference between S.hystrix clusters and the congener S.caliendrum (mean G(ST) 0.720). Multiple lines of evidence, including differences in habitat specificity, mitochondrial identity, Symbiodinium associations and morphology, corroborate the nuclear genetic evidence that these distinct clusters constitute different species. Hierarchical clustering analysis combined with more traditional population genetic methods provides a powerful approach for delimiting species and should be regularly applied to ensure that ecological and evolutionary patterns interpreted for single species are not confounded by the presence of cryptic species.

Population genetic studies in corals are mostly restricted to Australian and Caribbean species; studies in the northern Pacific are relatively limited. Using microsatellite markers, the population genetics of Acropora sp. 1 was examined between two regions in Japan, the Okinawa-Aka and Bonin Islands, which are separated by approximately 1,500 km of open water in a high-latitude area. Statistically significant but small genetic differentiation in Acropora sp. 1 was detected between and within these regions. Genetic diversity was not obviously reduced in populations of the Bonin Islands, which are relatively isolated. Thus, some level of connectivity appears to be maintained between the two regions, likely because of the high dispersal ability of this broadcast spawner.

To date, there is little genetic information available about its population structure. In this study, 16 polymorphic microsatellite loci were developed for this species and characterized in 182 wild individuals. The observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.236 to 0.912 and from 0.649 to 0.866, respectively.

These symbioses vary in the extent of their permanence in and specificity to the host. Although dinoflagellates are primarily free-living, Symbiodiniaceae diversified mainly as symbiotic lineages. Their genomes reveal conserved symbiosis-related gene functions and high sequence divergence. However, the evolutionary mechanisms that underpin the transition from the free-living lifestyle to symbiosis remain poorly understood. Here, we discuss the genome evolution of Symbiodiniaceae in diverse ecological niches across the broad spectrum of symbiotic associations, from free-living to putative obligate symbionts. We pose key questions regarding genome evolution vis-avis the transition of dinoflagellates from free-living to symbiotic and propose strategies for future research to better understand coral-dinoflagellate and other eukaryote-eukaryote symbioses.

J	Schwentner, M; Lorz, AN				Schwentner, Martin; Loerz, Anne-Nina			Population genetics of cold-water coral associated Pleustidae (Crustacea, Amphipoda) reveals cryptic diversity and recent expansion off Iceland	MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE			English	Article						Amphipoda; cold&#8208; water corals; deep&#8208; sea; Iceland; population genetics	GORGONIAN CORALS; REYKJANES RIDGE; DEEP; ATLANTIC; BIODIVERSITY; GASTROPOD; INFERENCE; HABITAT; MIMICRY; REEFS	Amphipoda are a diverse and important faunal component of deep-sea habitats worldwide. However, relatively little is known about species that are associated with cold-water corals, in particular concerning their genetic diversity, population genetic processes, population differentiation, and potential host specificity. We exemplarily investigate these questions studying three pleustid species-Stenopleustes aff. malmgreni (Boeck, 1871), Stenopleustes aff. nodifera (Sars, 1883) and Neopleustes aff. boecki (Hansen, 1888)-that are associated with cold-water corals and polychaete assemblages along the Reykjanes Ridge southwest of Iceland. We sequenced mitochondrial COI and performed ddRAD to study thousands of nuclear loci. These species and a pair of morphologically cryptic species within Stenopleustes aff. nodifera were consistently delimited by COI and ddRAD. We conclude that all of our studied species are new to science, raising the number of pleustids reported from cold-water corals to six. Two species were collected only once, and these species exhibited high levels of inbreeding, suggesting little exchange with other populations, which might be a result of strong host specificity. The other two species were wider distributed, with very low differentiation among populations, even between populations separated by 130 km. These species showed signs of recent population expansions, possibly in relation to changes in the cold-water coral associated ecosystem (e.g., due to glacial cycles and/or volcanic or geothermal activities). They had lower levels of inbreeding and were each associated with three different host coral species, which might facilitate dispersal and gene flow. Our results show divergent population genetic patterns for the studied pleustid species. These might be attributed to the species' host specificity and highlight important differences among species with seemingly similar life-styles. Species diversities appear to be greatly underestimated, limiting our abilities to truly assess the vulnerability of the fauna living in these threatened cold-water coral habitats.

This paper addresses the search for new coral molecular markers and investigates the applicability of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), the internal transcribed spacer region 1 (ITS1), and the pocilloporin gene to the question of intraspecific variation in the scleractinian coral Pocillopora verrucosa along the southeast African coastline. The COI fragment was 710 bp long and was identical for P. verrucosa (n = 10) and P. damicornis (n = 3). Only two different ITS1 sequences were found (differing by 13 bp insertion), but more importantly, 24% of the sequences were heterogenous indicating that different multiple copies of the sequence exist. Pocilloporin is an intronless gene that was absolutely conserved throughout all P. verrucosa populations (n = 50). Thus, the three DNA regions studied appear unsuitable for the population genetic analyses of P. verrucosa.

Six priorities to advance the science and practice of coral reef restoration worldwide	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						corals; coral interventions; coral reefs; coral restoration; reefs; restoration		Coral reef restoration is a rapidly growing movement galvanized by the accelerating degradation of the world's tropical coral reefs. The need for concerted and collaborative action focused on the recovery of coral reef ecosystems coalesced in the creation of the Coral Restoration Consortium (CRC) in 2017. In March 2020, the CRC leadership team met for a biennial review of international coral reef restoration efforts and a discussion of perceived knowledge and implementation bottlenecks that may impair scalability and efficacy. Herein we present six priorities wherein the CRC will foster scientific advancement and collaboration to: (1) increase restoration efficiency, focusing on scale and cost-effectiveness of deployment; (2) scale up larval-based coral restoration efforts, emphasizing recruit health, growth, and survival; (3) ensure restoration of threatened coral species proceeds within a population-genetics management context; (4) support a holistic approach to coral reef ecosystem restoration; (5) develop and promote the use of standardized terms and metrics for coral reef restoration; and (6) support coral reef restoration practitioners working in diverse geographic locations. These priorities are not exhaustive nor do we imply that accomplishing these tasks alone will be sufficient to restore coral reefs globally; rather these are topics where we feel the CRC community of practice can make timely and significant contributions to facilitate the growth of coral reef restoration as a practical conservation strategy. The goal for these collective actions is to provide tangible, local-scale advancements in reef condition that offset declines resulting from local and global stressors including climate change.

Toward predicting bleaching response from genomic data, we generated a chromosome-scale genome assembly for the coral Acropora millepora. We obtained whole-genome sequences for 237 phenotyped samples collected at 12 reefs along the Great Barrier Reef, among which we inferred little population structure. Scanning the genome for evidence of local adaptation, we detected signatures of long-term balancing selection in the heat-shock co-chaperone sacsin. We conducted a genome-wide association study of visual bleaching score for 213 samples, incorporating the polygenic score derived from it into a predictive model for bleaching in the wild. These results set the stage for genomics-based approaches in conservation strategies.

In order to develop microsatellite markers to reveal the genetic connectivity of I. palifera in the Kenting reefs, southern Taiwan, we applied a stepwise approach including Illumina sequencing, primer screening, and validation. DNA sequences of each 6,363,035 read pairs were assembled with high coverage and sequencing depth, and 1,173,835 potential SSRs were identified. A set of 60,986 primers were designed and tested, and six novel microsatellite markers with three type motifs, including 3 di- and 3 tetra- repeats, were successfully isolated. The ranges in number of alleles per locus and observed and expected heterozygosities were 3-5, 0.444-0.538, and 0.375-0.565, respectively. Application of these loci to the genetic diversity of an I. palifera population that experienced bleaching events in the Kenting reef between 1998 and 2015 showed a signature admixture of three clusters without temporal variation. These loci are useful for studying population genetics in the genus Isopora. Our results suggest that next-generation sequencing technology is convenient and cost-effective and can be utilized to isolate microsatellites in other reef-building corals.

Since then, the invasive behavior of this encrusting, coral-killing sponge has been observed in many coral reefs in the West Pacific. From 2015, its occurrence has expanded westward to the Indian Ocean. Although many studies have investigated the morphology, ecology, and symbiotic cyanobacteria of this sponge, little is known of its population genetics and demography. In this study, a mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) fragment and nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) were sequenced to reveal the genetic variation of T. hoshinota collected from 11 marine ecoregions throughout the Indo-West Pacific. Both of the statistical parsimony networks based on the COI and nuclear ITS2 were dominated by a common haplotype. Pairwise F-ST and Isolation-by-distance by Mantel test of ITS2 showed moderate gene flow existed among most populations in the marine ecoregions of West Pacific, Coral Triangle, and Eastern Indian Ocean, but with a restricted gene flow between these regions and Maldives in the Central Indian Ocean. Demographic analyses of most T. hoshinota populations were consistent with the mutation-drift equilibrium, except for the Sulawesi Sea and Maldives, which showed bottlenecks following recent expansion. Our results suggest that while long-range dispersal might explain the capability of T. hoshinota to spread in the IWP, stable population demography might account for the long-term persistence of T. hoshinota outbreaks on local reefs.

Population genetics of the banded coral shrimp, Stenopus hispidus (Olivier, 1811), in the Indonesian archipelago	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Microsatellite variation; Population subdivision; Conservation; Marine protected areas; Speciation; Habitat heterogeneity	BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS; MICROSATELLITE DNA; REEF FISH; MARINE; SPECIATION; CONSERVATION; CENTERS; PROGRAM; CONNECTIVITY; SOFTWARE	The population genetics of the banded coral shrimp, Stenopus hispidus (Olivier, 1811) from the Indonesian Archipelago were investigated. We genotyped 387 individuals collected from 11 sampling locations throughout Indonesia at 15 microsatellite loci. Bayesian clustering methods revealed evidence of three genetically distinct clusters. F-ST' and F-ST values are generally low, but significant. This was unexpected given the comparatively small geographic scale over which this survey was performed, approximately 2000km in an East to West orientation, even more so when accounting for the pan tropical distribution and long pelagic larval duration (210 days) of S. hispidus. Factors other than larval dispersal must be promoting population differentiation. In this case, genetic partitions appear to correspond to differing habitat types, possibly allowing selection to augment any oceanographic, geographic or biological barriers to gene flow, the resulting genetic differentiation is a source of evolutionary novelty and could facilitate reproductive isolation ultimately resulting in parapatric speciation.

Assessment of Mesophotic Coral Ecosystem Connectivity for Proposed Expansion of a Marine Sanctuary in the Northwest Gulf of Mexico: Population Genetics	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						population genetics; mesophotic coral ecosystems; northwest Gulf of Mexico; Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary; Montastraea cavernosa; microsatellites; sanctuary expansion; marine spatial planning	FLOWER GARDEN BANKS; MICROSATELLITE NULL ALLELES; MONTASTRAEA-CAVERNOSA; SEASCAPE GENETICS; ECOLOGY; REEF; HISTORY; REGION; COMMUNITIES; ASSEMBLAGES	While there are several areas containing shallow coral habitats in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), the availability of suitable reef habitat at mesophotic depths (similar to 30-150 m) along the continental shelf margin suggests the potential for ecologically connected coral populations across hundreds of kilometers in the northwest (NW) GOM. The NW GOM includes a relatively high proportion of mesophotic habitats, including salt diapirs in Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS), Bright Bank, and McGrail Bank, the latter two being Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPCs). In response to a proposed expansion plan for the sanctuary boundaries to include additional mesophotic banks in the NW GOM, we investigated the genetic connectivity of the depth-generalist coral Montastraea cavernosa, a ubiquitous member of scleractinian communities throughout the Tropical Western Atlantic. Montastraea cavernosa populations in the NW GOM demonstrated strong connectivity with relatively high levels of gene flow and no significant genetic differentiation occurring over banks up to 120 km apart. Historical migration models based on genetic data predicted panmixia of M. cavernosa across the NW GOM. The comparisons between genetic and biophysical models (see Garavelli et al., 2018) highlight not only the importance of incorporating multiple assessments of connectivity into management schemes, but also the potentially stochastic nature of oceanographic patterns in the NW GOM and their effect on migration estimates among coral habitats. These trends indicate that M. cavernosa populations have remained well-connected in the NW GOM and that coral populations on each bank have likely been receiving larval recruitment through time. Thus, M. cavernosa populations should be managed as a combined unit within the NW GOM, which supports the proposal to expand the NMS boundaries to include mesophotic habitats beyond West and East FGB.

Geography and spawning season drive genetic divergence among populations of the hard coral Acropora tenuis from Indonesia and Western Australia	CORAL REEFS			English	Article						Coral spawning; Connectivity; Dispersal; Gene flow; Genetic divergence	REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; GENOTYPIC DIVERSITY; INTERTIDAL SNAILS; LEEUWIN CURRENT; CONNECTIVITY; MARINE; REEF; VARIABILITY; DISPERSAL; SOFTWARE	It has long been hypothesized that Western Australian coral reefs are genetically connected to those in Indonesia via long-distance dispersal, and that this connection may influence the timing of annual mass coral spawning on Western Australian coral reefs. This genetic connection has not been tested, and it requires re-evaluation because spawning patterns of Western Australian corals are not as synchronous or seasonal as originally thought. Here, we used population genetics to examine patterns of gene flow among populations of the scleractinian coral Acropora tenuis in Indonesia and Western Australia. Analysis of microsatellite data showed that Indonesian and Australian populations are highly genetically differentiated. Importantly, this genetic divergence is associated with differences in the seasonal spawning time of A. tenuis between the two regions, with Indonesian populations dominated by 'spring' spawners and Western Australian populations dominated by 'autumn' spawners, indicating that spawning season has an important influence on genetic structure. Furthermore, negligible gene flow between Indonesia and Western Australia indicates that the recolonization of inshore Western Australian populations since the Last Glacial Maximum was independent of input from Indonesian populations.

In addition, current methods of scleractinian coral recruit identification destroy the tissue, precluding molecular or genomic analysis of these samples. A genetic method was developed to distinguish among coral species commonly observed in Caribbean recruitment studies and to facilitate further genetic analysis of these samples. Application of this method to monitoring recruitment at the Flower Garden Banks (FGB) and the Florida Keys (FK) throughout the 2000 to 2001 and 2001 to 2002 reproductive seasons revealed almost exclusive recruitment from 2 brooding species Agaricia agaricites and Porites astreoides. Recruitment at the FGB was significantly higher than across the FK. Significant spatial variation in recruitment was observed within the FK, and although more recruits were observed in 2001 to 2002, there was no significant temporal variation. Differences in local adult populations (e.g. population sizes and live coral coverage), post-settlement mortality and general reef health were likely contributors to disparities in recruitment levels of brooding corals observed at these reefs.

Microsatellite loci for Symbiodinium goreaui and other Clade C Symbiodinium	CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES			English	Article						Symbiodinium; Microsatellites; Population genetics; Coral reefs		The genus Symbiodinium comprises a diverse group of dinoflagellates known for their obligate relationship with reef-building corals. Members of the sub-genus 'clade C' are abundant, geographically wide-spread, as well as genetically and ecologically diverse. Coral colonies harboring clade C are often the most exposed to physical stressors. The genotypic diversity, dispersal and genetic connectivity exhibited by these Symbiodinium are the subjects of an increasing number of population genetic studies utilizing microsatellites. Here we describe 18 new microsatellite loci and test their utility across four common clade C types. We obtained multi-locus genotypes with individual level resolution in each of these types. Our results indicate that multi-locus genotypes can be obtained for many members of clade C using a subset of these markers. Data from these markers may assess population dynamics during coral bleaching and recovery as well as resolve boundaries to genetic recombination among these closely related, yet ecologically distinct, lineages.

J	Zayasu, Y; Satoh, N; Shinzato, C				Zayasu, Yuna; Satoh, Noriyuki; Shinzato, Chuya			Genetic diversity of farmed and wild populations of the reef-building coral, Acropora tenuis	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						coral reefs; microsatellite; outplanting nursery corals; population genetics; reef restoration; transplantation	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; RESTORATION; TRANSPLANTATION; HYBRIDIZATION; CONSERVATION; JUVENILES; SOFTWARE; ISLANDS; MARKERS	Transplantation of nursery-farmed corals is a primary management tool for restoration of degraded coral reefs. However, there have been concerns about the potential loss of genetic diversity in nurseries due to asexual propagation methods used to prepare transplants. Two coral nurseries at Maeganeku and Onna, Okinawa Island, Japan, furnish source material for regional restoration activities. Using 13 microsatellite markers, this study compared the genetic diversity of 132 Acropora tenuis colonies from these nurseries with that of 298 wild colonies from 15 sites across the Nansei Islands. Even though no clonal colonies were detected at wild sites, we estimated clonal richness of farmed corals to be 0.523 (Maeganeku) and 0.579 (Onna). Genotypic diversity is high in the nursery populations, 0.894 (Maeganeku) and 0.937 (Onna), but lower than in the natural populations (1.000). However, expected heterozygosity did not differ significantly between locations, including the coral nurseries (one-way analysis of variance, p > 0.05). Inbreeding coefficients of nursery populations (Onna, -0.019 to Maeganeku, 0.097) fell within the range of estimates from wild populations (Sesoko, -0.058 to Maeda, 0.278). Furthermore, based on Structure analysis, farmed A. tenuis comprises the same genetic population that occupies the surrounding natural area. Thus, given no additional statistically significant increase of clonal colonies within nurseries, using farmed coral assemblages for reef restoration may be preferable to transplanting and damaging wild assemblages. Coral gametes of farmed colonies may also be used to produce coral larvae for transplantation of sexually propagated corals.

Three major theories (center of origins, center of accumulation, and center of overlap) have proposed mechanisms that lead to higher diversity in the Indonesian-Philippines area. Up to now, classic biogeography based on species richness is unable to distinguish the most likely model among the three. We investigate genetic approach as a new tool that could give evolutionary perspective in biogeography. The rationale of such an approach is that genetic diversity has been found to be correlated to species richness. First results on coral reef fishes, revealed a hierarchy of the factors affecting the genetic diversity and consequently the species richness.

Microsatellite loci for Symbiodinium A3 (S. fitti) a common algal symbiont among Caribbean Acropora (stony corals) and Indo-Pacific giant clams (Tridacna)	CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES			English	Article						Acropora; Dinoflagellate; Genotype; Population genetics; Symbiodinium; Tridacna; Zooxanthellae	DINOPHYCEAE; DIVERSITY	We developed ten polymorphic microsatellite loci for S. fitti (type A3), and tested their utility on a Caribbean population associated with the coral Acropora palmata and an Indo-Pacific population harbored by the giant clam Tridacna maxima. Our analyses identified from 3 to 8 alleles for each haploid locus. Diversity (R) indices were 0.48 for the Indo-Pacific and 0.81 for the Caribbean. Greater than 95% of the samples possessed a single, symbiont, multilocus genotype (MLG). Among their many uses for the study of coral-algal symbioses, population genetic markers provide insight on the potential for symbiont dispersal, can be used to assess symbiont population stability/longevity in hospite, and partition symbiont diversity into reproductively isolated operational taxonomic units (i.e. species).

Population genetic studies are helpful for estimating the genetic connectivity among populations of marine sessile organisms with metapopulation structures such as corals. Moreover, the relationship between latitude and genetic diversity is informative when evaluating the fragility of populations. In this study, using highly variable markers, we examined the population genetics of the broadcast-spawning coral Acropora digitifera at 19 sites in seven regions along the 1,000 km long island chain of Nansei Islands, Japan. This area includes both subtropical and temperate habitats. Thus, the coral populations around the Nansei Islands in Japan are northern peripheral populations that would be subjected to environmental stresses different from those in tropical areas. The existence of high genetic connectivity across this large geographic area was suggested for all sites (F-ST <= 0.033) although small but significant genetic differentiation was detected among populations in geographically close sites and regions. In addition, A. digitifera appears to be distributed throughout the Nansei Islands without losing genetic diversity. Therefore, A. digitifera populations in the Nansei Islands may be able to recover relatively rapidly even when high disturbances of coral communities occur locally if populations on other reefs are properly maintained.

Microsatellite loci for the host-generalist "zooxanthella" Symbiodinium trenchi and other Clade D Symbiodinium	CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES			English	Article						Dinoflagellate; Genotype; Population genetics; Symbiodinium; Zooxanthellae	GENUS SYMBIODINIUM; CORAL ENDOSYMBIONTS; BLEACHING EVENT; SYMBIONT; AMPLIFICATION; DIVERSITY	Nine new polymorphic microsatellites were developed for Symbiodinium trenchi (sensu type D1a). These loci were tested on populations of S. trenchi from corals in Palau and 3-19 alleles were observed at each haploid locus with an average of 7 alleles. Many of the primer sets successfully amplified loci within other members of Symbiodinium clade D, demonstrating their utility across the group. Clade D Symbiodinium spp. are generally regarded as thermally tolerant and are common in coral reef habitats with warm, turbid, and/or variable environmental conditions. These population genetic markers are therefore useful for investigating how stress-tolerant symbionts may respond to climate warming through range expansion and/or by developing new associations with various host cnidarians. Additionally, the cross-lineage utility of these markers should help delineate the evolutionary relationships among members of this clade.

Development of microsatellite markers from four Hawaiian corals: Acropora cytherea, Fungia scutaria, Montipora capitata and Porites lobata	CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES			English	Article						Scleractinian; Zooxanthellae; Symbiodinium; Connectivity; Population genetics; Phylogeography	HAPLOTYPE RECONSTRUCTION; SOFTWARE; LOCI	Comprehensive population genetic studies of coral communities are comparatively rare, because of the scarcity of population genetic markers. The Hawaiian archipelago offers a unique perspective into understanding the population genetic structuring of this ecologically important group of organisms. Here we report the development of microsatellite marker libraries from holobiont extracts of four corals: Acropora cytherea (n = 50), Fungia scutaria (n = 118), Montipora capitata (n = 140) and Porites lobata (n = 149). Blast searches indicate that these libraries contain microsatellites from both the coral host and Symbiodinium endosymbionts from each coral. In addition, we also present redesigned primers for the nuclear coding region (atps beta) for use in M. capitata. We report testing and optimization for seven of these microsatellites from A. cytherea, and eight microsatellites and the atpsb locus from M. capitata. Using 25 individuals per species collected from each French Frigate Shoals (FF) and Johnston Atoll (JO), the number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 9. Expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.38 to 0.85 and 0.08 to 0.87 for A. cytherea and M. capitata, respectively. We expect that these libraries will be a valuable resource and provide additional useful microsatellite markers for both the coral host and zooxanthellae.

Symbiodinium population genetics: testing for species boundaries and analysing samples with mixed genotypes	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Editorial Material						dispersal; microsatellites; population genetics; species boundaries; Symbiodinium	REEF CORALS; GEOGRAPHIC-DISTRIBUTION; CRYPTIC DIVERSITY; HOST; DINOFLAGELLATE; ENDOSYMBIONTS; SPECIFICITY; SYMBIONT; DINOPHYCEAE; HABITAT	Population genetic markers are increasingly being used to study the diversity, ecology and evolution of Symbiodinium, a group of eukaryotic microbes that are often mutualistic with reef-building corals. Population genetic markers can resolve individual clones, or strains, from samples of host tissue; however, samples may comprise different species that may confound interpretations of gene flow and genetic structure. Here, we propose a method for resolving species from population genetic data using tests for genetic recombination. Assigning individuals to genetically recombining populations prior to further analyses avoids critical errors in the interpretation of gene flow and dispersal. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, we first apply this method to a simulated data set. We then use the method to resolve two species of host generalist Symbiodinium that commonly co-occur in reef-building corals collected from Indo-West Pacific reefs. We demonstrate that the method is robust even when some hosts contain genotypes from two distinct species. Finally, we examine population genetic data sets from two recently published papers in Molecular Ecology. We show that each strongly supports a two species interpretation, which significantly changes the original conclusions presented in these studies. When combined with available phylogenetic and ecological evidence, the use of population genetic data offers a robust method for unambiguously delimiting morphologically cryptic species.

Neutral genetic theory predicts that rare species will have lower genetic diversity than common species. To examine the association between genetic diversity and rarity, variation at eight DNA microsatellite markers was documented for 14 Acropora species that display different patterns of distribution and abundance in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Our results show that the relationship between rarity and genetic diversity is not a positive linear association because, contrary to expectations, some rare species are genetically diverse and some populations of common species are genetically depleted. Our data suggest that inbreeding is the most likely mechanism of genetic depletion in both rare and common corals, and that hybridization is the most likely explanation for higher than expected levels of genetic diversity in rare species. A significant hypothesis generated from our study with direct conservation implications is that as a group, Acropora corals have lower genetic diversity at neutral microsatellite loci than may be expected from their taxonomic diversity, and this may suggest a heightened susceptibility to environmental change. This hypothesis requires validation based on genetic diversity estimates derived from a large portion of the genome.

For marine organisms, short pelagic larval duration (PLD) and small population size are characteristics generally assumed to associate with low genetic diversity. The ecological diversity of organisms may also affect genetic diversity with an expected corollary that more restricted habitat and dietary requirements could lead to a reduced genetic diversity because of pronounced genetic structuring. Here, we tested whether groups of species with narrower trophic niches displayed lower genetic diversity than those with broader niches. In order to test those predictions, we used different trophic guilds (i.e., groups of species having similar trophic habits) of coral reef damselfishes in Moorea (French Polynesia) for which we determined their genetic diversity using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) and their trophic ecology with stomach contents and stable isotope data. We found that pelagic feeders- the guild picking zooplankton in the water column- exhibited the lowest genetic diversity despite having the longest PLD and the largest population size. This guild had also the lowest variation in habitat characteristics and dietary composition compared to benthic feeders (i.e., those mainly grazing on algae) and the intermediate group (i.e., those feeding on zooplankton, filamentous algae and small benthic invertebrates). Our findings highlight the association between trophic ecology and genetic diversity that should be more commonly investigated in population genetics.

Sekisei Lagoon and areas in its vicinity are impacted by the same stresses. Sekisei Lagoon is the largest coral reef area in Japan covering an area of almost 15 km x 20 km. Being situated upstream of Kuroshio Current, coral reefs in this area could supply larvae to downstream such as the Ryukyu Archipelago, facilitating high biodiversity. To conserve corals in such an area, estimation of larval dispersal among populations is essential because connectivity via larval dispersal is associated with the time for replenishment after disturbance. Isolated coral populations have a higher risk of local extinction. The purpose of this study is to reveal genetically isolated populations of brooding corals with short larval durations in and around Sekisei Lagoon. For this purpose, we utilized both population genetic analysis and larval dispersal simulations. Based on genotyping of 929 colonies of blue coral, Heliopora spp., collected from 22 sites around Sekisei Lagoon, genetic analysis suggested self-recruitment with connectivity in the southeastern sites and northwestern sites. Particle-tracking larval dispersal simulations also revealed similar patterns, corroborating the genetic results. These results suggest that lagoonal scale connectivity among populations of Heliopora spp. in Sekisei Lagoon is limited, as expected based on its short larval duration. Our results highlight the fact that most of the Heliopora spp. populations are genetically isolated, even inside Sekisei Lagoon, implying that the likelihood of being replenished by larval supply from surrounding populations after a disturbance is low and have a higher risk of local extinction than other coral species with high larval dispersal potential.

One of the most favourable scenarios for speciation with gene flow is established when a single trait is both under disruptive natural selection and used to cue assortative mating. Here, we demonstrate the potential for a single trait, colour pattern, to drive incipient speciation in the genus Hypoplectrus (Serranidae), coral reef fishes known for their striking colour polymorphism. We provide data demonstrating that sympatric Hypoplectrus colour morphs mate assortatively and are genetically distinct. Furthermore, we identify ecological conditions conducive to disruptive selection on colour pattern by presenting behavioural evidence of aggressive mimicry, whereby predatory Hypoplectrus colour morphs mimic the colour patterns of non-predatory reef fish species to increase their success approaching and attacking prey. We propose that colour-based assortative mating, combined with disruptive selection on colour pattern, is driving speciation in Hypoplectrus coral reef fishes.

New Species of Closely Related Endosymbiotic Dinoflagellates in the Greater Caribbean have Niches Corresponding to Host Coral Phylogeny	JOURNAL OF EUKARYOTIC MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Breviolum; Clade B; ecological specialization; endosymbiosis; Faviidae; Meandrinidae; Symbiodiniaceae	SMALL-SUBUNIT RDNA; SP-NOV.; REEF CORALS; SYMBIODINIUM DINOPHYCEAE; BLEACHING SUSCEPTIBILITY; SYMBIONT SPECIFICITY; POPULATION-GENETICS; INDO-PACIFIC; DIVERSITY; ECOLOGY	Symbiotic dinoflagellates in the genus Breviolum (formerly Symbiodinium Clade B) dominate coral communities in shallow waters across the Greater Caribbean. While some formally described species exist, mounting genetic, and ecological evidence indicate that numerous more comprise this genus, many of which are closely related. To test this, colonies of common reef-building corals were sampled across a large geographical range. Phylogenetic and population genetic markers then used to examine evolutionary divergence and delineate boundaries of genetic recombination. Three new candidate species were distinguished by fixed differences in nucleotide sequences from nuclear and chloroplast DNA. Population connectivity was evident within each lineage over thousands of kilometers, however, substantial genetic structure persisted between lineages co-occurring within sampling locations, signifying reproductive isolation. While geographically widespread with overlapping distributions, each species is ecologically distinct, exhibiting specific mutualisms with phylogenetically distinct coral hosts. Moreover, significant differences in mean cell sizes provide some morphological evidence substantiating formal species distinctions. In providing evidence that satisfies the biological, phylogenetic, ecological, and morphological species concepts, we classify and formally name Breviolum faviinorum n. sp., primarily associated with Caribbean corals belonging to the Caribbean subfamily Faviinae; B. meandrinium n. sp., associated with corals belonging to the family Meandrinidae; and B. dendrogyrum n. sp., a symbiont harbored exclusively by the threatened coral Dendrogyra cylindrus. These findings support the primary importance of niche diversification (i.e. host habitat) in the speciation of symbiotic dinoflagellates.

Diversity in host-symbiont pairings on the sub-species level could be an unrecognized source of functional variation in response to stress. The Caribbean elkhorn coral, Acropora palmata, associates predominantly with one symbiont species (Symbiodinium 'fitti'), facilitating investigations of individual-level (genotype) interactions. Individual genotypes of both host and symbiont were resolved across the entire species' range. Most colonies of a particular animal genotype were dominated by one symbiont genotype (or strain) that may persist in the host for decades or more. While Symbiodinium are primarily clonal, the occurrence of recombinant genotypes indicates sexual recombination is the source of this genetic variation, and some evidence suggests this happens within the host. When these data are examined at spatial scales spanning the entire distribution of A. palmata, gene flow among animal populations was an order of magnitude greater than among populations of the symbiont. This suggests that independent micro-evolutionary processes created dissimilar population genetic structures between host and symbiont. The lower effective dispersal exhibited by the dinoflagellate raises questions regarding the extent to which populations of host and symbiont can co-evolve during times of rapid and substantial climate change. However, these findings also support a growing body of evidence, suggesting that genotype-by-genotype interactions may provide significant physiological variation, influencing the adaptive potential of symbiotic reef corals to severe selection.

Novel polymorphic microsatellite markers for population genetics of the endangered Caribbean star coral, Montastraea faveolata	MARINE BIODIVERSITY			English	Article						Montastraea annularis species complex; Scleractinia; Coral reef; Multiplex; Simple sequence repeats; SSR; Conservation; Connectivity	REEF-BUILDING CORALS; CONNECTIVITY	Montastraea faveolata is a reef-building Caribbean coral that is currently listed as endangered across its range. A better understanding of the population genetic structure, genetic diversity and connectivity is needed to make sound conservation plans for this species. Here, we describe nine novel polymorphic microsatellite loci mined from currently available sequence data. Loci were screened in two widely separated populations (n = 21 individuals per population) from the Flower Garden Banks (northern Gulf of Mexico) and Cura double dagger ao (Netherland Antilles, southern Caribbean). Allelic diversity ranged from 3 to 16 and observed heterozygosities ranged from 0.095 to 0.905. For all loci but one, the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium hypothesis was not rejected within each population. These loci failed to amplify symbiont DNA isolated from pure Symbiodinium cultures, confirming their coral-specific origin. We also describe a multiplexing protocol for these markers reducing the costs and time required for future genetic studies. Finally, all markers were tested in the two sister species, M. franksi and M. annularis, and successful amplification and polymorphism were confirmed. The marker panel reported here, in combination with previously published markers for the same species complex, will facilitate coral reef connectivity research for this ecologically important genus, Montastraea, across the Caribbean.

Studies of coral reef taxa have suggested that hybridization predominantly occurs between parapatric species distributed along biogeographic suture zones. By contrast, little is known about the extent of sympatric hybridization on coral reefs, despite the large amount of biogeographic overlap shared by many coral reef species. Here, we investigate if the propensity for hybridization along suture zones represents a general phenomenon among coral reef fishes, by focusing on the marine angelfishes (family Pomacanthidae). Although hybridization has been reported for this family, it has not been thoroughly surveyed, with more recent hybridization studies focusing instead on closely related species from a population genetics perspective. We provide a comprehensive survey of hybridization among the Pomacanthidae, characterize the upper limits of genetic divergences between hybridizing species and investigate the occurrence of sympatric hybridization within this group. We report the occurrence of hybridization involving 42 species (48% of the family) from all but one genus of the Pomacanthidae. Our results indicate that the marine angelfishes are among the groups of coral reef fishes with the highest incidences of hybridization, not only between sympatric species, but also between deeply divergent lineages.

Genetic variation at five polymorphic loci was examined using allozyme electrophoresis. The nearshore population consisted almost exclusively of male individuals, and more males than females were found in all populations studied. Deviations of heterozygosity from that predicted under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium indicated that asexual reproduction occurred in all populations. Estimates of the level of asexual reproduction using the ratios of the number of sexually produced individuals to sample size, observed genotypic diversity to expected genotypic diversity, and number of genotypes to sample size confirmed that this reproductive mode was more important at the nearshore reef compared to the two offshore reefs. There were large differences in genotypic frequencies between males and females. F-statistics on clonal genotypic frequencies were not statistically significant between populations for neither females or males, suggesting high dispersal of larvae between reefs. A higher mortality of females during larval or early post-settlement stages, or reduced dispersal capability of female larvae are the most likely reasons for biased sex ratios.

We collected specimens (n = 582) from 20 sites across Palau. Cytochrome oxidase subunit I analyses show private haplotypes at all sites examined, with a clear separation between outer and inner reef locations, and a unique population within isolated Nikko Bay. Oceanographic isolation between the waters of Nikko Bay, inner and outer reefs may contribute to our observed genetic differentiation. Our results indicate past demographic expansion of C. maximum across the region and also indicate that multiple sites of both inner and outer reef locations would need to be protected to conserve this species' genetic diversity, including unique Nikko Bay. These results demonstrate the utility of C. maximum as a good species to investigate gene flow across small scales (< 10 km) as seen in Palau.

However, recent investigations have revealed that the current morphological classification is inadequate to represent genetic lineages. In this study, we isolated and characterized novel microsatellite loci from morphological Pocillopora meandrina (Type 1) and Pocillopora acuta (Type 5). Furthermore, we characterized previously reported microsatellite loci. A total of 27 loci (13 novel loci) proved useful for population genetic analyses at two sites in the Ryukyu Archipelago, in the northwestern Pacific. Clonal diversity differed in each genetic lineage. Genetic structure suggested by microsatellites corresponded to clusters in a phylogenetic tree constructed from a mitochondrial open reading frame (mtORF). In addition, we found an unknown mitochondrial haplotype of this mtORF. These microsatellite loci will be useful for studies of connectivity and genetic diversity of Pocillopora populations, and will also support coral reef conservation.

However, other species from the same family (Dendrophylliidae) produce larvae asexually, and closely connected polyps of B. elegans, potentially the result of asexual reproduction, are commonly observed in the field. Here, we use a combination of laboratory experiments, controlled crosses, and genetic surveys of field-collected individuals to demonstrate (1) marker allozymes are inherited in accordance with Mendel's laws, (2) polyps that are connected in the field are not genetically identical, and (3) laboratory manipulation of a single polyp can produce a second polyp on the aboral side of the original, but not adjacent to the original. In combination, these results suggest that the larvae of B. elegans result from mictic sexual reproduction, and that connected polyps result not from asexual budding but rather from the fusion of genetically distinct individuals.

Genetic relatedness does not retain spatial pattern across multiple spatial scales: dispersal and colonization in the coral, Pocillopora damicornis	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						coral reproduction; lace coral; landscape genetics; larval dispersal	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; POPULATION-GENETICS; SCLERACTINIAN CORAL; GENOTYPIC DIVERSITY; BROODING CORAL; ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION; LARVAL DISPERSAL; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISTANCE	Patterns of isolation by distance are uncommon in coral populations. Here, we depart from historical trends of large-scale, geographical genetic analyses by scaling down to a single patch reef in Kane'ohe Bay, Hawai'i, USA, and map and genotype all colonies of the coral, Pocillopora damicornis. Six polymorphic microsatellite loci were used to assess population genetic and clonal structure and to calculate individual colony pairwise relatedness values. Our results point to an inbred, highly clonal reef (between 53 and 116 clonal lineages of 2352 genotyped colonies) with a much skewed genet frequency distribution (over 70% of the reef was composed of just seven genotypes). Spatial autocorrelation analyses revealed that corals found close together on the reef were more genetically related than corals further apart. Spatial genetic structure disappears, however, as spatial scale increases and then becomes negative at the largest distances. Stratified, random sampling of three neighbouring reefs confirms that reefs are demographically open and inter-reef genetic structuring was not detected. Attributing process to pattern in corals is complicated by their mixed reproductive strategies. Separate autocorrelation analyses, however, show that the spatial distribution of both clones and nonclones contributes to spatial genetic structure. Overall, we demonstrate genetic structure on an intrareef scale and genetic panmixia on an inter-reef scale indicating that, for P.damicornis, the effect of small- and large-scale dispersal processes on genetic diversity are not the same. By starting from an interindividual, intrareef level before scaling up to an inter-reef level, this study demonstrates that isolation-by-distance patterns for the coral P.damicornis are limited to small scales and highlights the importance of investigating genetic patterns and ecological processes at multiple scales.

Population structure and connectivity of the mountainous star coral, Orbicella faveolata, throughout the wider Caribbean region	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Caribbean; connectivity; coral reef; gene flow; population genetics	MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA; GULF-OF-MEXICO; MONTASTRAEA-ANNULARIS COMPLEX; PELAGIC LARVAL DURATION; REEF-BUILDING CORALS; FLOWER GARDEN BANKS; BARRIER-REEF; MARINE POPULATIONS; GENE FLOW; HETEROZYGOTE DEFICIENCIES	As coral reefs continue to decline worldwide, it becomes ever more necessary to understand the connectivity between coral populations to develop efficient management strategies facilitating survival and adaptation of coral reefs in the future. Orbicella faveolata is one of the most important reef-building corals in the Caribbean and has recently experienced severe population reductions. Here, we utilize a panel of nine microsatellite loci to evaluate the genetic structure of O.faveolata and to infer connectivity across ten sites spanning the wider Caribbean region. Populations are generally well-mixed throughout the basin (F-ST=0.038), although notable patterns of substructure arise at local and regional scales. Eastern and western populations appear segregated with a genetic break around the Mona Passage in the north, as has been shown previously in other species; however, we find evidence for significant connectivity between Curacao and Mexico, suggesting that the southern margin of this barrier is permeable to dispersal. Our results also identify a strong genetic break within the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System associated with complex oceanographic patterns that promote larval retention in southern Belize. Additionally, the diverse genetic signature at Flower Garden Banks suggests its possible function as a downstream genetic sink. The findings reported here are relevant to the ongoing conservation efforts for this important and threatened species, and contribute to the growing understanding of large-scale coral reef connectivity throughout the wider Caribbean.

An Indo-West Pacific 'zooxanthella' invasive to the western Atlantic finds its way to the Eastern Pacific via an introduced Caribbean coral	CORAL REEFS			English	Article						Eastern Pacific; Introduced species; Population genetics; Symbiodinium trenchii	GENETIC DATA; REEF CORALS; CLADE D; DIVERSITY; SPECIFICITY; ANTHOZOA; CNIDARIA; ENDOSYMBIONTS; POCILLOPORA; DIVERGENCE	Phylogenetic evidence indicates that Siderastrea glynni, a species of coral thought to be endemic to the Eastern Pacific, is actually more likely to be Si. siderea introduced from the Atlantic. Our analyses of the endosymbionts of Si. glynni (Symbiodinium) substantiate this as an introduced species; attempts to conserve and list Si. glynni as an endangered species are probably unwarranted. The specimens we examined harbored Symbiodinium trenchii and some also contained Sy. goreaui, symbionts that occur with Si. siderea in the Atlantic. Moreover, the genotype of Sy. trenchii (a single strain defined by ten diallelic microsatellite loci) was genetically distinct from genotypes of Sy. 'glynni,' also in Clade D, found abundantly in colonies of Pocillopora throughout the region. Furthermore, the strain of Sy. trenchii grouped with genotypes from the Greater Caribbean, an inbred population that was recently introduced from the Indo-West Pacific. This secondary introduction suggests that strains of Caribbean Sy. trenchii are capable of dispersal into new reef coral communities where this symbiont does not presently exist.

Mortality events have recurrently affected this species during the last decade. Thus, knowledge of its genetic structure, population diversity, and connectivity is needed to accomplish suitable conservation plans. In order to obtain a better understanding of the population genetics of this species, 13 highly variable microsatellites markers were developed from a naturally bleached colony. The developed primers failed to amplify zooxanthella DNA, isolated from C. caespitosa, verifying that these markers were of the coral and not algal symbiont origin. The degree of polymorphism of these loci was tested on tissue samples from 28 colonies. The allele number for each loci ranged from 2 to 13 (mean N-a = 5.4), with an average observed heterozygosity of 0.42 (H-e = 0.43) and all loci were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. These new markers should be useful in future conservation genetic studies and will help to improve the resolution of the individual identification within this coral species. Primers were also tested in Oculina patagonica, with successful amplifications of several loci.

Population connectivity and genetic offset in the spawning coral Acropora digitifera in Western Australia	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						broadcast corals; climate change; gene-environmental associations; North-west Australia; population genetics	MARINE; REEFS; GRADIENTS; CLIMATE; GENOME; DISPERSAL; VULNERABILITY; DIVERSITY; COASTAL; MARKERS	Anthropogenic climate change has caused widespread loss of species biodiversity and ecosystem productivity across the globe, particularly on tropical coral reefs. Predicting the future vulnerability of reef-building corals, the foundation species of coral reef ecosystems, is crucial for cost-effective conservation planning in the Anthropocene. In this study, we combine regional population genetic connectivity and seascape analyses to explore patterns of genetic offset (the mismatch of gene-environmental associations under future climate conditions) in Acropora digitifera across 12 degrees of latitude in Western Australia. Our data revealed a pattern of restricted gene flow and limited genetic connectivity among geographically distant reef systems. Environmental association analyses identified a suite of loci strongly associated with the regional temperature variation. These loci helped forecast future genetic offset in gradient forest and generalized dissimilarity models. These analyses predicted pronounced differences in the response of different reef systems in Western Australia to rising temperatures. Under the most optimistic future warming scenario (RCP 2.6), we predicted a general pattern of increasing genetic offset with latitude. Under the extreme climate scenario (RCP 8.5 in 2090-2100), coral populations at the Ningaloo World Heritage Area were predicted to experience a higher mismatch between current allele frequencies and those required to cope with local environmental change, compared to populations in the inshore Kimberley region. The study suggests complex and spatially heterogeneous patterns of climate-change vulnerability in coral populations across Western Australia, reinforcing the notion that regionally tailored conservation efforts will be most effective at managing coral reef resilience into the future.

Connectivity and stability of mesophotic coral reefs	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Connectivity; Deep coral reefs; Gene flow; Heterotrophy; Mesophotic zone; Refugia	INDO-PACIFIC LIONFISH; LENGTH POLYMORPHISM AFLP; DEEP FORE-REEF; FLORIDA-KEYS; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; STYLOPHORA-PISTILLATA; POPULATION-GENETICS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PRISTIPOMOIDES-MULTIDENS; MACROALGAL COMMUNITIES	Mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs), occurring at depths of 30 to over 150 m, represents the deep continuum of adjacent shallow coral reefs about which little is known. These reefs are most developed, and most frequently studied, in areas where light penetration is high and photosymbiotic reef-builders (corals) can persist as common members of the benthic community. The upper mesophotic zone typically extends to 60 m and comprises communities that are generally similar to those found in shallow reef systems. Below 60 m, the lower mesophotic zone is dominated by sponges and algae that are uncommon or absent from shallower areas, and a fish fauna that is largely specialized to these intermediate depths. It is likely that these ecosystems are much more widespread and important than was previously recognized. MCEs have the potential to function as refugia for shallow reefs because many disturbances in the upper 30 m may leave MCEs largely intact. Ontogenetic movement and spawning migrations by reef fishes provide an important ecological component to connectivity between shallow and mesophotic reefs and may represent the effective range of larval dispersal. However, there is currently limited information on genetic connectivity between deep and shallow coral reef populations, and this is a critical gap in understanding the role of MCEs in coral reef resilience. Here we review the connectivity and trophic relationships between the shallow and mesophotic coral reefs, the potential role of MCEs as refugia, and the effects of a new biological invader that exposes critical gaps in our understanding of the stability of these ecosystems.

Demographic histories shape population genomics of the common coral grouper (Plectropomus leopardus)	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS			English	Article						fisheries management; molecular evolution; population genetics - empirical	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; R-PACKAGE; SPAWNING AGGREGATIONS; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; FISH; TROUT; DIVERGENCE; SEA; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; ADAPTATION	Many coral reef fishes display remarkable genetic and phenotypic variation across their geographic ranges. Understanding how historical and contemporary processes have shaped these patterns remains a focal question in evolutionary biology since they reveal how diversity is generated and how it may respond to future environmental change. Here, we compare the population genomics and demographic histories of a commercially and ecologically important coral reef fish, the common coral grouper (Plectropomus leopardus [Lacepede 1802]), across two adjoining regions (the Great Barrier Reef; GBR, and the Coral Sea, Australia) spanning approximately 14 degrees of latitude and 9 degrees of longitude. We analysed 4548 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers across 11 sites and show that genetic connectivity between regions is low, despite their relative proximity (similar to 100km) and an absence of any obvious geographic barrier. Inferred demographic histories using 10,479 markers suggest that the Coral Sea population was founded by a small number of GBR individuals and that divergence occurred similar to 190 kya under a model of isolation with asymmetric migration. We detected population expansions in both regions, but estimates of contemporary effective population sizes were approximately 50% smaller in Coral Sea sites, which also had lower genetic diversity. Our results suggest that P. leopardus in the Coral Sea have experienced a long period of isolation that precedes the recent glacial period (similar to 10-120 kya) and may be vulnerable to localized disturbances due to their relative reliance on local larval replenishment. While it is difficult to determine the underlying events that led to the divergence of the Coral Sea and GBR lineages, we show that even geographically proximate populations of a widely dispersed coral reef fish can have vastly different evolutionary histories.

Incongruent patterns of genetic connectivity among four ophiuroid species with differing coral host specificity on North Atlantic seamounts	MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE			English	Article						Ophiuroids; population genetics; seamount	DNA-SEQUENCE VARIATION; AMPHIPHOLIS-SQUAMATA ECHINODERMATA; NEW-ENGLAND; BATHYMETRIC PATTERNS; POPULATION-GENETICS; GULF-STREAM; COMPARATIVE PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; WESTERN ATLANTIC; BENTHIC HABITAT	Seamounts are considered to play a defining role in the evolution and diversity of marine fauna, acting as 'stepping-stones' for dispersal, regional centers of genetic isolation and speciation, and refugia for deep-sea populations. This study focused on the patterns of dispersal and genetic connectivity of four seamount ophiuroid species (Asteroschema clavigera, Ophiocreas oedipus, Ophioplinthaca abyssalis, and Ophioplinthaca chelys) displaying differing levels of associative (epifaunal) specificity to cold-water coral hosts inhabiting the New England and Corner Rise Seamount chains, and Muir Seamount in the Northwestern Atlantic. Analyses of mt16S and mtCOI revealed evidence for recent population expansion and high gene flow for all four species. However, species-specific genetic differentiation was significant based on seamount region and depth. Significant differences were found among regional seamount groups for A. clavigera, within seamount regions and seamounts for O. chelys, among 250-m depth intervals for A. clavigera, among 100-m depth intervals for O. oedipus, and there were indications of isolation by distance for A. clavigera and O. oedipus. In addition, A. clavigera and O. oedipus, broadcast spawners with high fidelity to specific coral hosts, displayed predominantly westward historical migration, whereas the ophioplinthacids, with lower host-specificity, displayed predominantly eastward migration. No congruent patterns of historical migration were evident among species and seamounts, yet these patterns can be correlated with species-specific host specificity, specific depth strata, and dispersal strategies. Conservation efforts to protect seamount ecosystems should promote multi-species approaches to genetic connectivity, and consider the impact of the 'dependence' of biodiversity on host fauna in these vulnerable marine ecosystems.

Using 16 polymorphic microsatellite loci, this study examined clonality, genetic differentiation, and connectivity of genetically identified P. acuta (n=428) in the Bolinao-Anda Reef Complex (BARC), Philippines, characterized by varying levels of wave exposure. Estimates of clonal richness indicate that the populations are largely derived from asexual reproduction, more likely via dispersal of ameiotic larvae. Clonal richness, population density, and mean colony size vary with wave exposure, suggesting the potential influence of local-scale disturbance on clonality, reproductive mode, and population structure. Populations in low-energy environments were characterized by greater colony density, larger colonies, and a greater proportion of clones compared to high-energy environments. Despite evidence for realized clonal dispersal of P. acuta extending up to 22 km, significant genetic differentiation among BARC populations reveals restricted gene flow at small spatial scales. Moreover, genetic differentiation is more pronounced when considering the spatial distribution of clones (F-ST including clones=0.059; F-ST excluding clones=0.028), suggesting that (1) asexually produced propagules are likely retained locally and across-site settlement is not as common; and (2) sexually derived propagules may have broader scales of dispersal. This study reexamines the population genetics of this often-problematic coral and underlines the importance of contextualizing site and species biology in designing or enhancing management towards the maintenance of functional genetic diversity and pathways of connectivity among populations.

While studies have revealed the importance of palaeogeographic changes in shaping phylogeographic patterns in multiple marine fauna, the role of reproductive behaviour is rarely considered in reef fishes. We investigated the population genetics of three commercially important aggregating grouper species in the Indo-West Pacific, namely the camouflage grouper Epinephelus polyphekadion, the squaretail coral grouper Plectropomus areolatus, and the common coral trout P. leopardus, with similar life histories but distinct spatio-temporal characteristics in their patterns of forming spawning aggregations.ResultsBy examining their mitochondrial control region and 9-11 microsatellite markers, we found an overarching influence of palaeogeographic events in the population structure of all species, with genetic breaks largely coinciding with major biogeographic barriers. The divergence time of major lineages in these species coincide with the Pleistocene glaciations. Higher connectivity is evident in E. polyphekadion and P. areolatus that assemble in larger numbers at fewer spawning aggregations and in distinctive offshore locations than in P. leopardus which has multiple small, shelf platform aggregations.ConclusionsWhile palaeogeographic events played an important role in shaping the population structure of the target species, the disparity in population connectivity detected may be partly attributable to differences in their reproductive behaviour, highlighting the need for more investigations on this characteristic and the need to consider reproductive mode in studies of connectivity and population genetics.

Population connectivity among shallow and mesophotic Montastraea cavernosa corals in the Gulf of Mexico identifies potential for refugia	CORAL REEFS			English	Article						Population genetics; Mesophotic coral ecosystems; Deep reef refugia hypothesis; Vertical connectivity; Montastraea cavernosa; Marine spatial planning	FLOWER GARDEN BANKS; MICROSATELLITE NULL ALLELES; BARRIER-REEF SYSTEM; WEST FLORIDA SHELF; PULLEY RIDGE; CARIBBEAN CORAL; VERTICAL CONNECTIVITY; ORBICELLA-FAVEOLATA; LOOP CURRENT; DEEP	Successful management of spatially isolated coral reefs is contingent on an understanding of ecological connections across populations. To investigate genetic connectivity of the depth-generalist coral species Montastraea cavernosa, populations from both shallow (15-30m) and mesophotic coral ecosystems (30-70m) in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) were analyzed with microsatellite genotyping. A series of upstream and downstream sites were chosen in marine protected areas including Carrie Bow Cay, Belize; Flower Garden Banks and nearby mesophotic bank habitats; Pulley Ridge; and Dry Tortugas. Patterns of genetic diversity within the northwest GOM supported relatively open coral populations with high levels of gene flow between shallow and mesophotic depth zones, consistent with strong oceanographic patterns and hypothesized availability of coral reef habitats in the GOM. Conversely, genetic differentiation within Belize and the southeast GOM indicate relative isolation of shallow and mesophotic M. cavernosa populations in these regions. Structure analysis showed dominant genetic clusters within each region that did not correlate strongly with depth zones, and identified a cluster of unknown origin contributing to high differentiation at Pulley Ridge. Migration modeling predicted historical region-wide panmixia for most regions, with Pulley Ridge appearing to be a potential sink population. The GOM appears to demonstrate stronger evidence of vertical connectivity compared to elsewhere in the Tropical Western Atlantic, which may be the result of oceanographic variability and/or lack of local selection at depth. These findings are consistent with previous studies identifying genetic connectivity of broadcast-spawning corals across broad spatial scales and highlight the potential importance of mesophotic habitats in the GOM as larval sources to geographically distant populations.

Population genetic structure of the broadcast spawning coral, Montastraea cavernosa, demonstrates refugia potential of upper mesophotic populations in the Florida Keys	CORAL REEFS			English	Article						Population genetics; Genetic connectivity; Mesophotic coral ecosystems; Montastraea cavernosa; Marine protected areas	PULLEY RIDGE; ORBICELLA-FAVEOLATA; REEF; CONNECTIVITY; PATTERNS; DISEASE; ANNULARIS; SYMBIONTS; SOFTWARE; CLUSTERS	In the Florida Keys, coral cover on shallow reef systems (0-30 m) has declined over the past several decades, punctuated by severe losses during coral disease outbreaks and bleaching events. However, certain areas within the Florida Keys, especially the Dry Tortugas and many upper mesophotic habitats (30-60 m), have maintained relatively healthy coral communities, even in the face of recent severe and widespread coral disease outbreaks. Relatively little is known about the genetic connectivity of corals among these sites or the potential for mesophotic sites to act as refugia by contributing to metapopulation recovery and persistence. Using a paired shallow and upper mesophotic sampling design, we assessed the genetic connectivity of a dominant, broadcast spawning coral species, Montastraea cavernosa, across the Northern and Southern Dry Tortugas, Lower Florida Keys, and Upper Florida Keys. A genetic dataset based on a suite of > 9000 single-nucleotide polymorphism loci indicated that the level of vertical genetic connectivity between paired shallow and upper mesophotic populations varied significantly based on location. Shallow and upper mesophotic M. cavernosa populations in the Northern Dry Tortugas and the Upper Keys were genetically similar. In contrast, populations were significantly differentiated across depth in the Lower Keys and Southern Dry Tortugas. While upper mesophotic populations in the Lower Keys and Southern Dry Tortugas were distinct from their shallow counterparts, there was evidence of relatively high levels of genetic connectivity to both the shallow and upper mesophotic populations downstream in the Upper Keys. These results suggest that while vertical connectivity between paired shallow and mesophotic populations can vary, certain upper mesophotic populations may fill an important role in maintaining coral metapopulations throughout the Florida Keys and should be considered in future management strategies.

Species delimitation of common reef corals in the genus Pocillopora using nucleotide sequence phylogenies, population genetics and symbiosis ecology	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						biogeography; coral systematics; hybridization; Pocillopora; reciprocal monophyly; species boundaries; Tropical Eastern Pacific	NINO-SOUTHERN OSCILLATION; EASTERN PACIFIC; SCLERACTINIAN CORALS; EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY; DIVERSITY; INFERENCE; HYBRIDIZATION; MITOCHONDRIAL; SPECIFICITY; BOUNDARIES	Stony corals in the genus Pocillopora are among the most common and widely distributed of Indo-Pacific corals and, as such, are often the subject of physiological and ecological research. In the far Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP), they are major constituents of shallow coral communities, exhibiting considerable variability in colony shape and branch morphology and marked differences in response to thermal stress. Numerous intermediates occur between morphospecies that may relate to extensive hybridization. The diversity of the Pocillopora genus in the TEP was analysed genetically using nuclear ribosomal (ITS2) and mitochondrial (ORF) sequences, and population genetic markers (seven microsatellite loci). The resident dinoflagellate endosymbiont (Symbiodinium sp.) in each sample was also characterized using sequences of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) rDNA and the noncoding region of the chloroplast psbA minicircle. From these analyses, three symbiotically distinct, reproductively isolated, nonhybridizing, evolutionarily divergent animal lineages were identified. Designated types 1, 2 and 3, these groupings were incongruent with traditional morphospecies classification. Type 1 was abundant and widespread throughout the TEP; type 2 was restricted to the Clipperton Atoll; and type 3 was found only in Panama and the Galapagos Islands. Each type harboured a different Symbiodinium'species lineage' in Clade C, and only type 1 associated with the 'stress-tolerant'Symbiodinium glynni (D1). The accurate delineation of species and implementation of a proper taxonomy may profoundly improve our assessment of Pocillopora's reproductive biology, biogeographic distributions, and resilience to climate warming, information that must be considered when planning for the conservation of reef corals.

Extensive sympatry, cryptic diversity and introgression throughout the geographic distribution of two coral species complexes	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						Acropora; cryptic species; hybridization; population genetics; population structure	MONTASTRAEA-ANNULARIS; POPULATION-GENETICS; HYBRID ZONE; DELIMITATION; PROGRAM; HYBRIDIZATION; MITOCHONDRIAL; BOUNDARIES; SPECIATION; EVOLUTION	The identification of species is one of the most basic, and yet critically important, issues in biology with far-reaching potential implications for fields such as biodiversity conservation, population ecology and epidemiology. Morphology has long been the primary tool biologists have used to categorize life. However, we now know that a significant portion of natural diversity is morphologically hidden, and therefore, we must integrate nonmorphological tools into the description of biodiversity. Here, we demonstrate the utility of multilocus population genetic data for identifying and characterizing cryptic species complexes, even when species share large amounts of genetic variability. Specifically, we have used DNA sequence data from 12 genomic regions to characterize two widespread species complexes in the coral genus Acropora: A. cytherea and A. hyacinthus. These two morphospecies have each been sampled from 5 to 7 locations throughout their Indo-Pacific distributions, and with the use of structure and hierarchical clustering, we demonstrate the presence of at least six widespread cryptic species within these two morphospecies complexes. After identifying cryptic lineages, we then utilize the genetic data to examine the history of introgressive hybridization within and between these morphospecies complexes. Our data indicate that these two complexes form a global syngameon with consistent patterns of introgression between species across large geographic distributions.

An assessment of coral genetic diversity and adaptive potential provides a basis for coral reef protection. In this study, we selected the branching coral Pocillopora verrucosa, a widely distributed species in the tropical South China Sea (SCS), to carry out population genetic studies. To analyze the genetic diversity and structure of 319 P. verrucosa samples from 10 populations in 4 SCS regions, twelve pairs of microsatellite primers and two nuclear markers, ITS and beta-tub, were selected. Microsatellite marker results showed moderate genetic diversity for P. verrucosa in the SCS, but relatively low diversity in Dazhou Island and Yongxing Island. The haplotype network showed that P. verrucosa in the SCS was derived from two ancestors, which may be linked to geographical isolation in the Pleistocene glacial period. AMOVA (Phi(ST) = 0.3375) and F-ST pairwise analysis results based on beta-tub showed that the populations were highly differentiated, with most F-ST values (21/45) > 0.25. Yongxing and Qilianyu Islands populations were significantly different from those in the Xisha area. Mantel test results showed that genetic differentiation among P. verrucosa populations was significantly and positively correlated with both mean sea surface temperature (SST) and SST variance, and was not correlated with distance, chlorophyll-a, or turbidity. The reproductive mode of brooding planulae was an important factor contributing to high genetic differentiation among populations. The moderate genetic diversity of SCS P. verrucosa indicates that this population has a certain genetic potential in the context of global changes, but the high genetic differentiation between populations increases the risk of local degradation or extinction. This study provides a theoretical basis for the protection and restoration of SCS coral reefs.

Studies of species diversity and genetic connectivity within species are essential for the conservation of corals and coral reef ecosystems. We analyzed mitochondrial DNA sequence types and microsatellite genotypes of the broadcast-spawning coral, Galaxea fascicularis, from four regions in the subtropical Nansei Islands in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. Two types (soft and hard types) of nematocyst morphology are known in G. fascicularis and are significantly correlated with the length of a mitochondrial DNA noncoding sequence (soft type: mt-L; hard type: mt-S type). Using microsatellites, significant genetic differentiation was detected between the mitochondrial DNA sequence types in all regions. We also found a third genetic cluster (mt-L+), and this unexpected type may be a cryptic species of Galaxea. High clonal diversity was detected in both mt-L and mt-S types. Significant genetic differentiation, which was found among regions within a given type (F-ST = 0.009-0.024, all Ps <= 0.005 in mt-L; 0.009-0.032, all Ps <= 0.01 in mt-S), may result from the shorter larval development than in other broadcast-spawning corals, such as the genus Acropora. Nevertheless, intraspecific genetic diversity and connectivity have been maintained, and with both sexual and asexual reproduction, this species appears to have a potential for the recovery of populations after disturbance.

Notably, these partnerships create the foundation of coral reef ecosystems and are at risk of breaking down due to climate change. This symbiosis couples the fitness of the partners, where adaptations in one species can benefit the holobiont. However, the scales over which each partner can match their current-and future-environment are largely unknown. We investigated population genetic patterns of temperate anemones (Anthopleura spp.) and their endosymbiont Breviolum 'muscatinei', across an extensive geographical range to identify the spatial scales over which local adaptation is possible. Similar to previously published results, two solitary host species exhibited isolation by distance across hundreds of kilometres. However, symbionts exhibited genetic structure across multiple spatial scales, from geographical location to depth in the intertidal zone, and host species, suggesting that symbiont populations are more likely than their hosts to adaptively mitigate the impact of increasing temperatures.

J	Costantini, F; Abbiati, M				Costantini, Federica; Abbiati, Marco			Into the depth of population genetics: pattern of structuring in mesophotic red coral populations	CORAL REEFS			English	Article						Corallium rubrum; Microsatellites; Mediterranean Sea; ROV	MEDITERRANEAN CORALLIGENOUS ASSEMBLAGES; DEEP-SEA OCTOCORALS; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; RUBRUM; CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITY; SOFTWARE	Deep-sea reef-building corals are among the most conspicuous invertebrates inhabiting the hard-bottom habitats worldwide and are particularly susceptible to human threats. The precious red coral (Corallium rubrum, L. 1758) has a wide bathymetric distribution, from shallow up to 800 m depth, and represents a key species in the Mediterranean mesophotic reefs. Several studies have investigated genetic variability in shallow-water red coral populations, while geographic patterns in mesophotic habitats are largely unknown. This study investigated genetic variability of C. rubrum populations dwelling between 55 and 120 m depth, from the Ligurian to the Ionian Sea along about 1500 km of coastline. A total of 18 deep rocky banks were sampled. Colonies were analyzed by means of a set of microsatellite loci and the putative control region of the mitochondrial DNA. Collected data were compared with previous studies. Both types of molecular markers showed high genetic similarity between populations within the northern (Ligurian Sea and Tuscan Archipelago) and the southern (Tyrrhenian and Ionian seas) study areas. Variability in habitat features between the sampling sites did not affect the genetic variability of the populations. Conversely, the patchy distribution of suitable habitats affected populations' connectivity within and among deep coral banks. Based on these results and due to the emphasis on red coral protection in the Mediterranean Sea by international institutions, red coral could be promoted as a 'focal species' to develop management plans for the conservation of deep coralligenous reefs, a reservoir of marine biodiversity.

Here we present the first data on genetic diversity and clonal structure from these two species using a new set of microsatellite markers. High proportions of clones were observed, indicating that asexual reproduction has a major role in the local population dynamics and, therefore, represents one of the main reasons for the invasion success. Although no significant population structure was found, results suggest the occurrence of multiple invasions for T. coccinea and also that both species are being transported along the coast by vectors such as oil platforms and monobouys, spreading these invasive species. In addition to the description of novel microsatellite markers, this study sheds new light into the invasive process of Tubastraea.

Congruent patterns of connectivity can inform management for broadcast spawning corals on the Great Barrier Reef	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						Acropora millepora; Acropora tenuis; coral reef management; microsatellites; population genetics - empirical; seascape genetics	POPULATION GENETIC-STRUCTURE; ACROPORA-MILLEPORA CNIDARIA; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; GENOTYPIC DIVERSITY; LARVAL DISPERSAL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOW; SOFTWARE; NETWORKS; PROGRAM	Connectivity underpins the persistence and recovery of marine ecosystems. The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is the world's largest coral reef ecosystem and managed by an extensive network of no-take zones; however, information about connectivity was not available to optimize the network's configuration. We use multivariate analyses, Bayesian clustering algorithms and assignment tests of the largest population genetic data set for any organism on the GBR to date (Acropora tenuis, >2500 colonies; >50 reefs, genotyped for ten microsatellite loci) to demonstrate highly congruent patterns of connectivity between this common broadcast spawning reef-building coral and its congener Acropora millepora (similar to 950 colonies; 20 reefs, genotyped for 12 microsatellite loci). For both species, there is a genetic divide at around 19 degrees S latitude, most probably reflecting allopatric differentiation during the Pleistocene. GBR reefs north of 19 degrees S are essentially panmictic whereas southern reefs are genetically distinct with higher levels of genetic diversity and population structure, most notably genetic subdivision between inshore and offshore reefs south of 19 degrees S. These broadly congruent patterns of higher genetic diversities found on southern GBR reefs most likely represent the accumulation of alleles via the southward flowing East Australia Current. In addition, signatures of genetic admixture between the Coral Sea and outer-shelf reefs in the northern, central and southern GBR provide evidence of recent gene flow. Our connectivity results are consistent with predictions from recently published larval dispersal models for broadcast spawning corals on the GBR, thereby providing robust connectivity information about the dominant reef-building genus Acropora for coral reef managers.

The possibility that there are distinct genetic stocks of these species would affect the design of management strategies for their conservation. A recent resurgence of interest in identifying distinct stocks of swarming krill species has been driven by the development of genetic technologies that are more sensitive to subtle population structure than older methods. Previous studies of the population genetics of the Antarctic species Euphausia crystallorophias and E. superba and the boreal species Meganyctiphanes norvegica that used allozymes found no evidence of genetic population structure. More recent investigations using sequence variation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have exposed genetic differentiation between samples taken from different parts of each species' range. However, the underlying assumption of these studies that differentiation between samples is caused primarily by restricted gene flow between widely separated sampling sites may be incorrect. Our recent study of E. crystallorophias mtDNA variation has indicated that there is significant genetic differentiation between samples taken within one region. This has important implications for the design of future studies of krill population genetics, which must be able to accommodate this sympatric variance component as well as variance attributable to differences between regions. Genetic differentiation between stocks of krill in different regions therefore can not be adequately assessed unless multiple samples are taken from each region.

We assembled and annotated the genome sequence of the blacktail butterflyfish (Chaetodon austriacus), an Arabian region endemic species that is reliant on coral reefs for food and shelter. Using available bony fish (superclass Osteichthyes) genomes as a reference, a total of 28926 high-quality protein-coding genes were predicted from 13967 assembled scaffolds. The quality and completeness of the draft genome of C.austriacus suggest that it has the potential to serve as a resource for studies on the co-evolution of reef fish adaptations to the unique Red Sea environment, as well as a comparison of gene sequences between closely related congeneric species of butterflyfish distributed more broadly across the tropical Indo-Pacific.

We compared the genetic population structures of two coral reef fishes, Acanthurus triostegus and Chaetodon ulietensis, present on both sides of the atoll rim to determine whether there is evidence of reproductive isolation. Genetic surveys showed that the lagoonal and oceanic populations were statistically different at five loci (AAT*-3, GDA*, HPD*, MDH* and SDH*) in A. triostegus and three loci (PGI-2*, IDH* and PGD*) in C. ulietensis, producing high F-st values of 0.055 and 0.021, respectively. Our genetic and demographic data on these species suggest that both may be completing their life-cycles inside the lagoon, which leads us to question the common assumption that coral reef fishes require oceanic conditions for larval development.

Therefore, we assessed population structure and genetic diversity of Acropora tenuis, one of the dominant stony coral species in the Pacific, using 13 microsatellite markers to investigate 298 colonies from 15 locations across the Nansei Islands in southwestern Japan. Genetic diversity was not significant among sampling locations, even in possibly peripheral locations. In addition, our results showed that there are at least two populations of A. tenuis in the study area. The level of genetic differentiation between these populations was relatively low, but significant between many pairs of sampling locations. Directions of gene flow, which were estimated using a coalescence-based approach, suggest that gene flow not only occurs from south to north, but also from north to south in various locations. Consequently, the Yaeyama Islands and the Amami Islands are potential northern and southern sources of corals. On the other hand, the Miyako Islands and west central Okinawa Island are potential sink populations. The Kerama Islands and the vicinity of Taketomi Island are potential contact points of genetic subdivision of coral populations in the Nansei Islands. We found that genetic population structure of A. tenuis in the Nansei Islands is more complex than previously thought. These cryptic populations are very important for preserving genetic diversity and should be maintained.

Recently, local and global anthropogenic stresses on its habitat have led to this species being listed as threatened. Strong genetic differentiation has been observed between populations of H. coerulea that have been found only 500 m apart. Despite the wide geographical distribution of H. coerulea in the Indo-Pacific oceans, such localized genetic structuring has led to speculation about whether H. coerulea populations are completely isolated over different geographic scales (including speciation). To investigate gene flow in H. coerulea, we genotyped seven microsatellite loci in 611 H. coerulea colonies collected from along the Kuroshio Current. Genetic admixture analysis and principal coordinate analysis suggested the existence of two cryptic species in the studied area. In addition, distinct typical gross morphologies were shown by both these cryptic species. Patterns of isolation by distance were more obvious and significant when each genetic clade was analyzed separately than when the populations were analyzed together. In addition, we found that some populations had extremely low genotypic diversity. These findings indicate that these populations may be more threatened than previously believed and emphasize the threatened status of H. coerulea.

Here, we use multilocus microsatellite genotypes to assess the spatial genetic structure of two molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs, types and ) of the widespread coral Pocillopora damicornis on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and infer the extent of connectivity on spatial scales spanning from local habitat types to latitudinal sectors of the GBR. We found high genetic similarities over large spatial scales spanning > 1000km from the northern to the southern GBR, but also strong genetic differentiation at local scales in both MOTUs. The presence of a considerable number of first-generation migrants within the populations sampled (12% and 27% for types and , respectively) suggests that genetic differentiation over small spatial scales is probably a consequence of stochastic recruitment from different genetic pools into recently opened up spaces on the reef, for example, following major disturbance events. We explain high genetic similarity among populations over hundreds of kilometres by long competency periods of brooded zooxanthellate larvae and multiple larval release events each year, combined with strong longshore currents typical along the GBR. The lack of genetic evidence for predominantly clonal reproduction in adult populations of P.damicornis, which broods predominantly asexually produced larvae, further undermines the paradigm that brooded larvae settle close to parent colonies shortly after the release.

The planktonic nature of the early larval stages suggests a passive dispersal model where ocean currents would quickly cause panmixis over large spatial scales and prevent isolation of populations, a prerequisite for speciation. However, high biodiversity and species abundance in coral reefs contradict this panmixis hypothesis. Although ocean currents are a major force in larval dispersal, recent studies show far greater retention than predicted by advection models. We investigated the role of animal behavior in retention and homing of coral reef fish larvae resulting in two important discoveries: (i) Settling larvae are capable of olfactory discrimination and prefer the odor of their home reef, thereby demonstrating to us that nearby reefs smell different. (ii) Whereas one species showed panmixis as predicted from our advection model, another species showed significant genetic population substructure suggestive of strong homing. Thus, the smell of reefs could allow larvae to choose currents that return them to reefs in general and natal reefs in particular. As a consequence, reef populations can develop genetic differences that might lead to reproductive isolation.

The development of molecular tools in scleractinian corals' studies is faced with a list of obstacles, such as high cost, labor, time consuming, contamination with foreign DNA, and markers with low resolution. The AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) method, overcomes most of the obstacles listed above except of the difficulty of contamination by algal symbiont DNA. We compared the implication of two pre-DNA extraction treatments to obtain coral DNA free of algal contaminations, termed as CPEM, cell population enriched method, and TTEM, total tissue extraction method. The CPEM process result in pure coral DNA for all samples, but is time consuming, whereas in the TTEM process, approximately 25% to 18% of the samples are still contaminated by algal DNA. However, algal DNA contaminations in the PCR at 2.5 x 10(-1) ng level (approximately 100 algal cells) and below, did not amplify any new AFLP band or peak for neither radioactive nor florescence analyses. Therefore, even the TTEM process may be used because it is faster, easier to handle, and easily employed on a large amount of samples, with minimal contamination artifacts. When correctly employed, both methods are applicable to wide experimental manipulations.

Extreme mitochondrial variation in the Atlantic gall crab Opecarcinus hypostegus (Decapoda: Cryptochiridae) reveals adaptive genetic divergence over Agaricia coral hosts	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							POPULATION-GENETICS; NATURAL-SELECTION; FLOW; DIFFERENTIATION; DISPERSAL; CRUSTACEA; PATTERNS; SHALLOW; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; CONNECTIVITY	The effectiveness of migration in marine species exhibiting a pelagic larval stage is determined by various factors, such as ocean currents, pelagic larval stage duration and active habitat selection. Direct measurement of larval movements is difficult and, consequently, factors determining the gene flow patterns remain poorly understood for many species. Patterns of gene flow play a key role in maintaining genetic homogeneity in a species by dampening the effects of local adaptation. Coral-dwelling gall crabs (Cryptochiridae) are obligate symbionts of stony corals (Scleractinia). Preliminary data showed high genetic diversity on the COI gene for 19 Opecarcinus hypostegus specimens collected off Curacao. In this study, an additional 176 specimens were sequenced and used to characterize the population structure along the leeward side of Curacao. Extremely high COI genetic variation was observed, with 146 polymorphic sites and 187 unique haplotypes. To determine the cause of this high genetic diversity, various gene flow scenarios (geographical distance along the coast, genetic partitioning over depth, and genetic differentiation by coral host) were examined. Adaptive genetic divergence across Agariciidae host species is suggested to be the main cause for the observed high intra-specific variance, hypothesised as early signs of speciation in O. hypostegus.

What can population genetics studies tell us about the demographic, evolutionary and biogeographic consequences of this life cycle? Ten studies of geographical patterns of intraspecific genetic differentiation in reef fishes have been published. These studies have included 26 species/species complexes (14 in the family Pomacentridae, the remaining 12 in 9 different families) and have been about equally divided between the tropical Pacific and the tropical western Atlantic. A survey of these studies shows the following: (i) the existence of the pelagic larval stage appears to have led to high levels of gene flow even among populations separated by thousands of kilometres of open ocean; (ii) an apparent pattern of increased gene flow among populations connected by intermediate 'stepping stones'; (iii) very tentative evidence for a relationship between length of pelagic larval life and gene flow; (iv) no clear relationship between egg type (pelagic vs non-pelagic) and gene flow; and (v) suggestive evidence that damselfishes (family Pomacentridae) may have more restricted dispersal (less gene flow) than other reef fishes. The application of current and future molecular tools has the strong potential to clarify some of these relationships, particularly by using relatively neutral genetic markers. Additionally, discoveries of DNA markers having very high rates of mutation may allow tracking of demographically relevant levels of larval dispersal. Molecular tools are becoming especially valuable in uncovering the biogeographic and phylogenetic history of reef fishes. The one molecular study to date has suggested that at least some speciation events may have occurred during the climate changes and sea-level regressions associated with Pleistocene glacial episodes. Molecular tools need to be used to further explore the means by which high species diversity can be generated in the face of the apparently high gene flow observed in most coral-reef fishes.

A previous study indicated a low genetic diversity (Nei's genetic distance of < 0.003) for C. violacea of southern Taiwan (Lin 1992). Herein, we attempted to determine whether the low genetic differentiation extends to the South China Sea (SCS) by examining allozyme variations at 6 polymorphic loci. Snails were sampled from the Kuroshio region around Taiwan and the SCS which are 1500 km apart. The mean observed heterozygosity among the 7 populations varied from 0.155 to 0.293, with all indicating heterozygote deficiencies. We detected small but significant genetic differentiation among all populations (mean F-ST of 0.078); however, genetic distances (Nei's D) between populations were relatively low, ranging from 0 to 0.093. There was a positive trend, although insignificant, between the geographic distance and Nei's genetic distance (Mantel test, Z = 575.7, r = 0.66, p = 0.13). This pattern was confirmed by a UPGMA cluster analysis which showed that geographical-closed populations did not cluster together. The Kuroshio intrusion, high larval dispersal capability, and the availability of host pork tid corals may be responsible for these heterogeneities. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/47.1/17.pdf.

Multiple scales of genetic connectivity in a brooding coral on isolated reefs following catastrophic bleaching	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						dispersal; disturbance; recruitment; resilience; Scott Reef; Seriatopora hystrix	SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION ANALYSIS; CARIBBEAN CORAL; POPULATION-GENETICS; GENOTYPIC DIVERSITY; SERIATOPORA-HYSTRIX; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ACROPORA; FLOW; DISPERSAL; DISTANCE	Understanding the pattern of connectivity among populations is crucial for the development of realistic and spatially explicit population models in marine systems. Here we analysed variation at eight microsatellite loci to assess the genetic structure and to infer patterns of larval dispersal for a brooding coral, Seriatopora hystrix, at an isolated system of reefs in northern Western Australia. Spatial autocorrelation analyses show that populations are locally subdivided, and that the majority of larvae recruit to within 100 m of their natal colony. Further, a combination of F- and R- statistics showed significant differentiation at larger spatial scales (2-60 km) between sites, and this pattern was clearly not associated with distance. However, Bayesian analysis demonstrated that recruitment has been supplemented by less frequent but recent input of larvae from outside the local area; 2-6% of colonies were excluded from the site at which they were sampled. Individual assignments of these migrants to the most likely populations suggest that the majority of migrants were produced at the only site that was not decimated by a recent and catastrophic coral bleaching event. Furthermore, the only site that recovered to prebleaching levels received most of these immigrants. We conclude that the genetic structure of this brooding coral reflects its highly opportunistic life history, in which prolific, philopatric recruitment is occasionally supplemented by exogenously produced larvae.

Targeted heavily by the shell trade across their distribution area, these species have a poorly known population structure and genetics. Molecular techniques have been used to assess levels of inter- and intra-population genetic diversity in isolated populations of Nautilus in the northern sections of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia and in the Coral Sea. Distinct populations, physically separated by depths in excess of 1,000 m were examined. RAPD analysis of genetic differences showed limited differentiation of the "Northern GBR" populations and the "Coral Sea" populations. Discrimination between the two geographic groups was observed from these data. In addition, partial sequencing of the CoxI gene region, yielded 575 bp of sequence, which was aligned for 43 samples and phylogenetic trees constructed to examine genetic relationships. Two distinct clades were resolved in the resulting trees, representing the "Northern GBR" and "Coral Sea" population groups. Inter- and intra-population relationships are presented and discussed. The differentiation of the Nautilus populations from the Northern section of the Great Barrier Reef and those from the Coral Sea were supported by two distinctly different methodologies and the significance of this separation and the potential evolutionary divergence of these two population groups is discussed.

The Nansei Islands, extending more than 1000 km in southwestern Japan, are characterized by high levels of biodiversity and endemism, supported by coral reefs, which make this region ideal for assessing genetic attributes of coral populations. In this study, we conducted population genomic analyses based on genome-wide, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Acropora digitifera, a common species in the Nansei Islands. By merging newly obtained genome resequencing data with previously published data, we identified more than 4 million genome-wide SNPs in 303 colonies collected at 22 locations, with sequencing coverage ranging from 3.91x to 27.41x. While population structure analyses revealed genetic similarities between the southernmost and northernmost locations, separated by >1000 km, several subpopulations in intermediate locations suggested limited genetic admixture, indicating conflicting migration tendencies in the Nansei Islands. Although migration networks revealed a general tendency of northward migration along the Kuroshio Current, a substantial amount of southward migration was also detected, indicating important contributions of minor ocean currents to coral larval dispersal. Moreover, heterogeneity in the transition of effective population sizes among locations suggests different histories for individual subpopulations. The unexpected complexity of both past and present population dynamics in the Nansei Islands implies that heterogeneity of ocean currents and local environments, past and present, have influenced the population structure of this species, and similar unexpected population complexities may be expected for other marine species with similar reproductive modes.

Many reef species have shown significant genetic structure at small scales while apparently absent at large scales, a pattern often referred to as chaotic genetic patchiness. Here we use hierarchical sampling of population structure scored from a panel of microsatellite markers for the coral Acropora hyacinthus across the islands of Yap, Ngulu and Palau to evaluate hypotheses about the mechanisms of previously described chaotic genetic structure. As with previous studies, we find no isolation-by-distance within or between the three islands and high genetic structure between sites separated by as little as similar to 10 km on Palau. Using kinship among individual colonies, however, we find higher mean pairwise relatedness coefficients among individuals within sampling sites. Comparing population structure among hierarchical sampling scales, we show that the pattern of chaotic genetic patchiness reported previously appears to derive from genetic patches of local kin groups at small spatial scales. Genetic distinction of Palau from neighboring islands and high kinship among individuals within these kinship neighborhoods implies that the coral reefs of Palau apparently recovered through a mosaic of rare thermally tolerant colonies that survived the 1998 mass bleaching and are now spreading and recolonizing reefs as local kin groups. This pattern of recovery on Palau gives us a better understanding for effective coral reef conservation strategies in which protecting these rare survivors wherever they occur, rather than specific areas of reef habitat, is critical to increase coral reef resilience.

In this study, the composition of communities of the endosymbiont Symbiodinium and the population genetics of the coral host Platygyra verweyi were examined in a reef impacted by hot-water discharged from the outlet of a nuclear power plant in operation in Kenting, Southern Taiwan since 1984. The water at this site is 2.03.0 degrees C warmer than adjacent reefs in summer, which have an average seawater temperature of 29.0 degrees C. The data were compared with those for the same species at other sites within 12 km of the outlet site. Platygyra verwyei was associated with one or both of Symbiodinium types C3 (heat sensitive) and D1a (heat tolerant) at all sites with the latter being the dominant at the nuclear power plant outlet. The proportion of C3 in populations increased gradually with increasing distance from the hot-water discharge. Genetic analysis of the Platygyra verweyi host using mitochondrial and nuclear markers showed no genetic differentiation among sites. Changes in the composition of Symbiodinium types associated with P. verweyi among closely located sites in Kenting suggested that this coral might have acclimatized to the constant thermal stress by selective association with heat-tolerant Symbiodinium types, whereas the role of the host in adaptation was inconclusive.

Mutualistic microalgae co-diversify with reef corals that acquire symbionts during egg development	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article							EASTERN PACIFIC; POCILLOPORA-DAMICORNIS; SPECIES DELIMITATION; POPULATION-GENETICS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; CRYPTIC SPECIATION; INDO-PACIFIC; SYMBIODINIUM; HOST; DINOPHYCEAE	The application of molecular genetics has reinvigorated and improved how species are defined and investigated scientifically, especially for morphologically cryptic micro-organisms. Here we show how species recognition improves understanding of the ecology and evolution of mutualisms between reef-building corals and their mutualistic dinoflagellates (i.e. Symbiodiniaceae). A combination of genetic, ecological, and morphological evidence defines two sibling species of Cladocopium (formerly Symbiodinium Clade C), specific only to host corals in the common genus Pocillopora, which transmit their obligate symbionts during oogenesis. Cladocopium latusorum sp. nov. is symbiotic with P. grandis/meandrina while the smaller-celled C. pacificum sp. nov. associates with P. verrucosa. Both symbiont species form mutualisms with Pocillopora that brood their young. Populations of each species, like their hosts, are genetically well connected across the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean, indicating a capacity for long-range dispersal. A molecular clock approximates their speciation during the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene as Earth underwent cycles of precipitous cooling and warming; and corresponds to when their hosts were also diversifying. The long temporal and spatial maintenance of high host fidelity, as well as genetic connectivity across thousands of kilometers, indicates that distinct ecological attributes and close evolutionary histories will restrain the adaptive responses of corals and their specialized symbionts to rapid climate warming.

The aim of this study is to describe the reproductive biology of Caryophyllia inornata, a temperate species, and to increase the understanding of the reproductive strategies of Mediterranean corals. Samples of C. inornata were collected during SCUBA surveys at Elba island. Sexually active individuals displayed either male or female germ cells, showing a gonochoric sexuality. C. inornata exhibited an unusual pattern of embryogenesis. Embryos appeared throughout the whole year in males and in sexually inactive individuals, and they did not show a seasonal pattern of development, as usually expected for sexual reproduction. This observation suggests the possibility of asexual origin. These embryogenetic sexually inactive individuals were larger in size than the embryogenetic sexually active ones, and they might be senile polyps that preserve the ability to produce embryos only by agamic reproduction.

Integrating connectivity science and spatial conservation management of coral reefs in north-west Australia	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION			English	Article						Dispersal; Ecosystem-based marine spatial planning; Knowledge transfer; Marine Protected Area; Marine sanctuary; Population connectivity; Recruitment	HIGH POPULATION CONNECTIVITY; MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; LARVAL DISPERSAL; LEEUWIN CURRENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GENE FLOW; SELF-RECRUITMENT; FISH POPULATIONS; SPAWNING CORALS	The geographically isolated, environmentally unique and biologically diverse coral reefs of north-west Australia are under threat from climate change and other localised human impacts. Similar to many other regions around the world, effective mitigation of these threats through ecosystem-based marine spatial planning is currently constrained by a lack of knowledge of the extent and direction of dispersal of eggs, larvae, recruits, juveniles or adults among the coral reefs (termed population connectivity). Here, we present the outcomes of a series of consultations between Marine Protected Area planners, managers and scientists aimed at facilitating the integration of this connectivity knowledge into effective management guidelines and policy in north-west Australia. Through this process, we first synthesised current knowledge of population connectivity in the fields of oceanography, larval biology and population genetics, and then identified and answered to the best of our ability the most useful questions for the spatial planning of Marine Protected Area networks. Key findings indicate that these systems are likely ecologically independent for many coral reef organisms, with hard corals exhibiting the most localised dispersal of species studied so far. Thus, given that hard corals are also the habitat forming species, and that more widely dispersing species such as fish are likely less vulnerable to small scale disturbance, we propose that no-take areas that facilitate resilience of hard coral populations should maximise biodiversity more generally. This means no-take areas that are large enough to encompass routine dispersal distances of corals (10-20 km), and are spaced at similar distances, will not only maintain self-replenishment, but also aid recovery after disturbance through connectivity between no-take areas. The results can be applied in a regional and wider context, and provide a valuable template for transfer of scientific knowledge into effective policy. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

With relatively brief larval stages, damselfishes (Pomacentridae) are likely to exhibit limited dispersal. This study evaluates gene flow at three spatial scales in one species of coral reef damselfish, Dascyllus trimaculatus. Samples were collected at seven locations at Moorea, Society Islands, French Polynesia. Phylogenetic relationships and gene how based on mitochondrial control region DNA sequences between these locations were evaluated (first spatial scale). Although spatial structure was not found, molecular markers showed clear temporal structure, which may be because pulses of settling larvae have distinct genetic composition. Moorea samples were then compared with individuals from a distant island (750km), Rangiroa, Tuamotu Archipelago, French Polynesia (second spatial scale). Post-recruitment events (selection) and gene flow were probably responsible for the lack of structure observed between populations from Moorea and Rangiroa. Finally, samples from six Indo-West Pacific locations, Zanzibar, Indonesia, Japan, Christmas Island, Hawaii, and French Polynesia were compared (third spatial scale). Strong population structure was observed between Indo-West Pacific populations.

Evidences from the Southern Mediterranean commercial banks	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Red coral; Management; Tunisia; Population genetics; Connectivity; Colony size	MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA; RED CORAL; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; INFERENCE; SOFTWARE; INSIGHTS; MARKERS	The precious octocoral Corallium rubrum has a long history of exploitation in the Mediterranean Sea. Historically, harvesting followed the "boom and bust" cycles whereby newly discovered beds were overexploited to depletion. In the past, most of the red coral harvesting came form France, Italy, and Spain. Today, landing data show that Tunisia is the third largest supplier of C. rubrum. The aim of this study was to asses whether and how the exploitation effort affects size distribution and genetic diversity of Tunisian commercial populations. Biometric data and microsatellite markers were used to characterize 113 colonies collected on nine commercial banks. Size and branching pattern indicate that collected colonies are up to 100 years old with a high reproductive rate. Nevertheless, 38% of the colonies were undersized according to FAO-GFCM recommendations (basal diameter < 7 mm). Tunisian populations showed a weak genetic structuring and significant differentiation between coastal and offshore populations. Harvesting did not alter the structure of red coral populations. However, technological improvement and intensive harvesting of Tunisian banks, if not properly managed, may lead to their rapid depletion, causing long-lasting shifts in population demography and genetic structure, and the loss of this valuable resource.

J	von der Heyden, S				von der Heyden, Sophie			Making evolutionary history count: biodiversity planning for coral reef fishes and the conservation of evolutionary processes	CORAL REEFS			English	Review						Adaptation; Marine conservation genetics; Climate change; Population genetics; Phylogenetic diversity; Resilience	GENETIC DIVERSITY; PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY; MARINE; DNA; POPULATION; COLOR; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; RESILIENCE; SPECIATION; PERSPECTIVE	Anthropogenic activities are having devastating impacts on marine systems with numerous knock-on effects on trophic functioning, species interactions and an accelerated loss of biodiversity. Establishing conservation areas can not only protect biodiversity, but also confer resilience against changes to coral reefs and their inhabitants. Planning for protection and conservation in marine systems is complex, but usually focuses on maintaining levels of biodiversity and protecting special and unique landscape features while avoiding negative impacts to socio-economic benefits. Conversely, the integration of evolutionary processes that have shaped extant species assemblages is rarely taken into account. However, it is as important to protect processes as it is to protect patterns for maintaining the evolutionary trajectories of populations and species. This review focuses on different approaches for integrating genetic analyses, such as phylogenetic diversity, phylogeography and the delineation of management units, temporal and spatial monitoring of genetic diversity and quantification of adaptive variation for protecting evolutionary resilience, into marine spatial planning, specifically for coral reef fishes. Many of these concepts are not yet readily applied to coral reef fish studies, but this synthesis highlights their potential and the importance of including historical processes into systematic biodiversity planning for conserving not only extant, but also future, biodiversity and its evolutionary potential.

Hawaii Reef Connectivity Consortiu	The DNA of coral reef biodiversity: predicting and protecting genetic diversity of reef assemblages	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						population genetics; seascape genetics; landscape genetics; resilience; coral reefs; ecosystem-based management	SPECIES-DIVERSITY; POPULATION; PATTERNS; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITY; DRIVERS; FISHES	Conservation of ecological communities requires deepening our understanding of genetic diversity patterns and drivers at community-wide scales. Here, we use seascape genetic analysis of a diversity metric, allelic richness (AR), for 47 reef species sampled across 13 Hawaiian Islands to empirically demonstrate that large reefs high in coral cover harbour the greatest genetic diversity on average. We found that a species's life history (e.g. depth range and herbivory) mediates response of genetic diversity to seascape drivers in logical ways. Furthermore, a metric of combined multi-species AR showed strong coupling to species richness and habitat area, quality and stability that few species showed individually. We hypothesize that macro-ecological forces and species interactions, by mediating species turnover and occupancy (and thus a site's mean effective population size), influence the aggregate genetic diversity of a site, potentially allowing it to behave as an apparent emergent trait that is shaped by the dominant seascape drivers. The results highlight inherent feedbacks between ecology and genetics, raise concern that genetic resilience of entire reef communities is compromised by factors that reduce coral cover or available habitat, including thermal stress, and provide a foundation for new strategies for monitoring and preserving biodiversity of entire reef ecosystems.

Scleractinian corals are challenging to identify because of their ecophenotypic variation and morphological plasticity. In addition, molecular analyses have revealed the occurrence of cryptic speciation. Here, we describe a new cryptic lobophylliid genus and species Paraechinophyllia variabilis gen. nov., sp. nov., which is morphologically similar to Echinophyllia aspera and E. orpheensis. The new taxon occurs in Mayotte Island, Madagascar, the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. Six molecular markers (COI, 12S, ATP6-NAD4, NAD3-NAD5, histone H3 and ITS) and 46 morphological characters at three different levels (macromorphology, micromorphology and microstructure) were examined. The resulting molecular phylogenetic reconstruction showed that Paraechinophyllia gen. nov. represents a distinct group within the Lobophylliidae that diverged from the lineage leading to Echinophyllia and Oxypora in the Early Miocene, approximately 21.5 Ma. The morphological phylogenetic reconstruction clustered Paraechinophyllia gen. nov., Echinophyllia and Oxypora together in a single clade. A sole morphological character, calice relief, discriminated Paraechinophyllia gen. nov. from the latter two genera, suggesting that limited morphological variation has occurred over a long period. These results highlight the importance of cryptic taxa in reef corals, with implications for population genetics, ecological studies and conservation.

The genetic structure of these populations has been unknown. A question has arisen regarding whether there have been multiple invasions of this species. Five platforms were surveyed; only two were found to possess populations large enough to sample - GI-93C and MC-280A. Tissue samples were collected and analyzed via Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs). STRUCTURE analysis identified four genetically distinct clusters or groups among the two platforms. The MC-280A population exhibited an overwhelming association with only one genetic group. Although the three other groups were represented, they were present in small proportions - 1-5%. By contrast, the GI-93C population showed high genetic diversity, with colonies exhibiting association with all four groups in widely varying proportions. The lack of genetic variability on MC-280A most likely resulted from a single recruitment event on this more isolated platform. It is possible that this event could have been derived from a second invasion of this species. In that case, treatment of the invasive would best be focused on the species at the vector point (e.g., treating the hull or ballast water of a ship prior to reaching its destination) rather than in the already infected environment, to avoid repeated replacement invasions. On GI-93-C, the genetic variability was most likely the result of multiple recruitment events. Other possible factors causing the observed pattern could include recruitment from genetically diverse populations in the region and sampling from an older age population where reproduction could result in admixture.

We found that two morphotypes of Acropora divaricata spawned in August and/or September. The "robust" and "slender" morphotypes differed in branch width and in the diameter of axial corallites. Histological analyses showed that the onset of gamete production/maturation occurred from June onwards. Most of the other Acropora species spawned from late May to early June. A. florida, which spawned in May/June, initiated gamete production in early April. We assumed that the two morphotypes of A. divaricata were reproductively isolated from most of the other Acropora species because of differences in the spawning seasons. We found that the spawning seasons of the two morphotypes slightly overlapped in 2015 but not in 2019, and inter-morphotype gamete compatibility was high. However, population genetics analyses and a phylogeny of the mitochondrial d-loop region showed that they were genetically distinct and rarely hybridized. Thus, the broadcast-spawning coral A. divaricata might have speciated when there might have been only a low possibility of interspecific gamete interaction.

Acropora austera connectivity in the south-western Indian Ocean assessed using nuclear intron sequence data	MARINE BIOLOGY			English	Article							MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; CORAL POCILLOPORA-DAMICORNIS; MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; SCLERACTINIAN CORAL; GENE FLOW; GENOTYPIC DIVERSITY; POPULATION-GENETICS; COALESCENT APPROACH; SPECIES BOUNDARIES; STATISTICAL-METHOD	The hypervariable carbonic anhydrase 3/550 intron marker was sequenced in order to ascertain the levels of genetic variability and connectivity within and between reefal populations of the hard coral, Acropora austera, on the south-east African coastline. Populations were sampled from (north to south) Bazaruto and Inhaca islands (Mozambique), Rabbit Rock, Two-mile and Red Sands Reefs and Leadsman Shoal (Maputaland, South Africa). Populations at Inhaca Island contained two private alleles, part of the only monophyletic clade with fixed differences between populations in this study. Haplotype and nucleotide diversity were higher in the north of the study area. Indices of migration and haplotype sharing supported significant connectivity between populations in South Africa and Mozambique, which may be important in sustaining genetic diversity in the down-current South African A. austera populations. Measures of population subdivision indicated a significant amount of fixation of allele frequencies amongst populations. Although fine, such differentiation in a marker from the nuclear genome of a hard coral is consistent with some demographic isolation between A. austera populations in southern Mozambique and South Africa. Populations at Rabbit Rock and Inhaca Island were found to be significantly isolated from, and thus less connected to, A. austera populations at other reefs.	[Macdonald, Angus H. H.; Schleyer, M.

Geographic differences in vertical connectivity in the Caribbean coral Montastraea cavernosa despite high levels of horizontal connectivity at shallow depths	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; cnidarians; conservation genetics; deep reef refugia hypothesis; great star coral; mesophotic; population genetics-empirical	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; INBREEDING COEFFICIENTS; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; BROODING CORAL; DEEP REEFS; SYMBIODINIUM; DIVERSITY; PROGRAM; LIGHT	The deep reef refugia hypothesis proposes that deep reefs can act as local recruitment sources for shallow reefs following disturbance. To test this hypothesis, nine polymorphic DNA microsatellite loci were developed and used to assess vertical connectivity in 583 coral colonies of the Caribbean depth-generalist coral Montastraea cavernosa. Samples were collected from three depth zones (<= 10, 15-20 and >= 25 m) at sites in Florida (within the Upper Keys, Lower Keys and Dry Tortugas), Bermuda, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Migration rates were estimated to determine the probability of coral larval migration from shallow to deep and from deep to shallow. Finally, algal symbiont (Symbiodinium spp.) diversity and distribution were assessed in a subset of corals to test whether symbiont depth zonation might indicate limited vertical connectivity. Overall, analyses revealed significant genetic differentiation by depth in Florida, but not in Bermuda or the U.S. Virgin Islands, despite high levels of horizontal connectivity between these geographic locations at shallow depths. Within Florida, greater vertical connectivity was observed in the Dry Tortugas compared to the Lower or Upper Keys. However, at all sites, and regardless of the extent of vertical connectivity, migration occurred asymmetrically, with greater likelihood of migration from shallow to intermediate/deep habitats. Finally, most colonies hosted a single Symbiodinium type (C3), ruling out symbiont depth zonation of the dominant symbiont type as a structuring factor. Together, these findings suggest that the potential for shallow reefs to recover from deep-water refugia in M. cavernosa is location-specific, varying among and within geographic locations likely as a consequence of local hydrology.

Studying gene flow between small and disrupted marine ecosystems, such as the reefs along the Singapore Strait, is especially crucial due to their fragile nature. Here we sampled the ubiquitous coral species complex Pachyseris speciosa from seven sites in Singapore and applied genotyping-by-sequencing (nextRAD) for a fine-scale population genomic assessment. Our results confirm the existence of two clearly distinct, possibly cryptic, lineages that occur sympatrically at each of the seven sampling sites and are related to the "blue" and "green" lineages found in other parts of the Indo-Pacific. The closely related lineages show contrasting patterns characterised by panmixia and substantial (but unexplained) substructuring, respectively. Analysis of barriers and corridors to gene flow reveals limited connectivity between the two largest clusters of reefs at the eastern and western sectors of Singapore's southern coastal waters. Our results extend the geographic range of the two recently uncovered P. speciosa species, further confirming their status as distinct and widespread species. More broadly, our findings highlight how conservation and management strategies may maximise connectivity among Singapore's urbanised reef ecosystems.

We use Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) to investigate genetic patterns in the threatened coral, Acropora cervicornis, across the Florida Reef Tract (FRT) and the western Caribbean. Results show extensive population structure at regional scales and resolve previously unknown structure within the FRT. Different regions also exhibit up to threefold differences in genetic diversity (He), suggesting targeted management based on the goals and resources of each population is needed. Patterns of genetic diversity have a strong spatial component, and our results show Broward and the Lower Keys are among the most diverse populations in Florida. The genetic diversity of Caribbean staghorn coral is concentrated within populations and within individual reefs (AMOVA), highlighting the complex mosaic of population structure. This variance structure is similar over regional and local scales, which suggests that in situ nurseries are adequately capturing natural patterns of diversity, representing a resource that can replicate the average diversity of wild assemblages, serving to increase intraspecific diversity and potentially leading to improved biodiversity and ecosystem function. Results presented here can be translated into specific goals for the recovery of A. cervicornis, including active focus on low diversity areas, protection of high diversity and connectivity, and practical thresholds for responsible restoration.

Brooding reproductive modes appear to predominate among mesophotic-specialist corals and may limit genetic connectivity among populations. Using reduced representation genomic sequencing, we assessed spatial population genetic structure at 50 m depth in an ecologically important mesophotic-specialist species Agaricia grahamae, among locations in the Southern Caribbean. We also tested for hybridisation with the closely related (but depth-generalist) species Agaricia lamarcki, within their sympatric depth zone (50 m). In contrast to our expectations, no spatial genetic structure was detected between the reefs of Curacao and Bonaire (similar to 40 km apart) within A. grahamae. However, cryptic taxa were discovered within both taxonomic species, with those in A. lamarcki (incompletely) partitioned by depth and those in A. grahamae occurring sympatrically (at the same depth). Hybrid analyses and demographic modelling identified contemporary and historical gene flow among cryptic taxa, both within and between A. grahamae and A. lamarcki. These results (1) indicate that spatial connectivity and subsequent replenishment may be possible between islands of moderate geographic distances for A. grahamae, an ecologically important mesophotic species, (2) that cryptic taxa occur in the mesophotic zone and environmental selection along shallow to mesophotic depth gradients may drive divergence in depth-generalists such as A. lamarcki, and (3) highlight that gene flow links taxa within this relativity diverse Caribbean genus.

Cross-species amplification of 44 microsatellite loci developed for Chaetodon trifascialis, C. lunulatus and C. vagabundus in 22 related butterflyfish species	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES			English	Article						chaetodontidae; coral reef fishes; cross-species amplification; ecological specialization; microsatellite primer; population genetics	EXTINCTION VULNERABILITY; POPULATION CONNECTIVITY; REEF FISHES; CORAL; RESOURCE; MARKERS; DECLINE; RISK	Forty-four microsatellite primers developed for three species of butterflyfish were cross-tested against 22 related confamilial species. Amplification success and cross-species transferability of these markers were moderately high. Between 24 and 37 loci were amplified successfully in each species, with a mean success rate per species of 71.7% (+/- 1.8 SE). Rates of amplification success were comparable among primers designed for the three source species, ranging from a mean success rate per species of 16.9 loci (+/- 0.8 SE) for Chaetodon trifascialis source loci to 13.7 loci (+/- 1.5 SE) for C. vagabundus source loci. Polymorphism rates were high (76.1% +/- 3.1 SE of all successfully amplified loci), and 10 loci were polymorphic in all successfully amplified species (Tri14, B11, C5, D3, D113, D6, D117, D120, D111, D118). The number of alleles per polymorphic locus ranged from 2 to 8, and the average number of alleles across all polymorphic loci and all species was 3.6 (+/- 0.07 SE). Polymorphism rates were higher overall in primers designed for C. vagabundus (89.9% +/- 3.9 SE). Overall cross-testing success was lowest for Heniochus chrysostomus, the most phylogenetically divergent species. The significant cross-testing reported here provides a valuable resource that will enable population genetics studies to be undertaken on a range of butterflyfishes without the need for expensive and time-consuming de novo microsatellite development.

Fallen Pillars: The Past, Present, and Future Population Dynamics of a Rare, Specialist Coral-Algal Symbiosis	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						Dendrogyra cylindrus; climate change; population genetics; Symbiodiniaceae; rare species; clonal structure	SEA FAN CORAL; REEF-BUILDING CORAL; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; CARIBBEAN CORAL; COALESCENT HISTORIES; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; SEXUAL REPRODUCTION; MICROSATELLITE LOCI; CLONAL STRUCTURE; THERMAL-STRESS	With ongoing changes in climate, rare and ecologically specialized species are at increased risk of extinction. In sessile foundation fauna that reproduce asexually via fragmentation of existing colonies, the number of colonies does not reflect the number of genets and thus can obscure genotypic diversity. Colonies that are the product of fragmentation are not visually distinguishable from colonies that stem from sexual recruits. For this reason, molecular markers are necessary to assess genotypic variation and population structure in clonal organisms such as reef-building corals and their endosymbiotic dinoflagellates. For the rare Caribbean pillar coral, Dendrogyra cylindrus, and its endosymbiotic dinoflagellate, Breviolum dendrogyrum, we use de novo microsatellite markers to infer past demographic changes, describe modern population structure, and quantify the frequency of asexual reproduction. Our analyses show that D. cylindrus comprises three distinct populations across the Greater Caribbean whereas the symbiont could be differentiated into four populations, indicating barriers to gene flow differ between host and symbiont. In Florida, host and symbiont populations reproduced mainly asexually, yielding lower genotypic diversity than predicted from census size. When multiple coral ramets were present, they often associated with the same clonal strain of B. dendrogyrum, pointing to the high fidelity of this relationship. Models of past demographic events revealed no evidence for historical changes in population sizes, consistent with the paleontological record of D. cylindrus indicating it has been rare for hundreds of thousands of years. The most recent global thermal stress event likely triggered a severe disease outbreak among D. cylindrus in Florida, resulting in a severe population decline. Projections indicate a high likelihood that this species will become extinct in the Northern Greater Caribbean within a few decades. The ecosystem consequences of losing rare coral species and their symbionts with increasingly frequent extreme warming events are not known but require urgent study.

Here we use experimental crosses to examine mating compatibilities and breeding barriers in a group of sessile animals whose mating systems are primarily governed by interactions among free-spawned gametes. We found hybridization occurs readily in more than one-third of 42 species pairs from the common genera Acropora, Montipora and Platygyra. Mean fertilization success ranged from 1% to 50% in species crosses, but standard deviations about these means were large and in some cases, fertilization success in individual colony matings was greater than 95%. Cases of high fertility in individual, interspecific matings were found in all three genera. Hybridization occurred most readily between species that were morphologically similar, identifying areas where current taxonomic judgements may require further testing. However, cases of significant hybridization also occurred between species that are morphologically distinct. Evidence of in vitro hybridization combined with the lack of either temporal or spatial barriers to interbreeding among field populations of these species, indicates that natural hybridization may occur commonly between congeneric corals that are currently recognized as distinct species. We also detected mating incompatibilities between some colonies within some species. In some cases, incompatible colonies corresponded to distinct morphotypes, but not in others. Thus some breeding groups in scleractinian corals are potentially larger, but others are smaller, than would be predicted using morphological criteria. Gamete incompatibilities within a morphospecies that readily hybridizes with other species may be the result of a mating system that is governed by gamete-level interactions. Imprecision in the alignment of morphological and breeding boundaries suggests a single species concept may not apply to scleractinian corals and challenges the tacit assumption that currently defined coral species encompass biological, evolutionary and phylogenetic species. Hybridization between supposedly isolated species introduces a reticulate nature to the evolution of corals and has profound implications for present understanding of the population genetics, phylogenetics, and evolutionary biology of scleractinian corals.

Characterization of new microsatellite loci for population genetic studies in the Smooth Cauliflower Coral (Stylophora sp.)	CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES			English	Article						Stylophora; Tetra and dinucleotide microsatellites; Red Sea; Coral	PISTILLATA; SOFTWARE; FLOW	A total of one hundred microsatellites loci were selected from the draft genome of Stylophora pistillata and evaluated in previously characterized samples of Stylophora cf pistillata from the Red Sea. 17 loci were amplified successfully and tested in 24 individuals from samples belonging to a single population from the central region of the Red Sea. The number of alleles ranged from 3 to 15 alleles per locus, while observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.292 to 0.95. Six of these loci showed significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) expectations, and 4/136 paired loci comparisons suggested linkage disequilibrium after Bonferroni corrections. After excluding loci with significant HWE deviation and evidence of null alleles, average genetic diversity over loci in the population studied (N = 24, Nloci = 11) was 0.701 +/- A 0.380. This indicates that these loci can be used effectively to evaluate genetic diversity and undertake population genetics studies in Stylophora sp. populations.

More recently there has been a paradigm shift in the understanding of coral dispersal, driven largely by genetic evidence, which has put greater emphasis on self-recruitment and larval retention. There is now a growing body of evidence that morphologically cryptic species exist within many recognized 'species' of stony corals. Here, we characterise levels of genetic divergence within and between five species of Acropora sampled from disparate populations spanning the Indo-Pacific Oceans. We find that strong regional genetic differentiation corresponding to the separation of the Indian and Pacific Ocean basins is a consistent pattern in three of the five species examined. Furthermore, the extent of allopatric divergence within species is similar to that observed between species, implying negligible contemporary gene flow between regions in four of the five species examined. This is consistent with the presence of numerous morphologically cryptic allopatric subspecies or incipient Acropora species. If this is confirmed, the conservation status of several species, which are already demonstrably threatened, would require re-evaluation so that risks including silent extinctions and inappropriate translocations are properly managed.

Alveopora japonica, a small zooxanthellate scleractinian coral, occurs in the northwestern Pacific including Taiwan, Japan, and Jeju Island in Korea. The northern populations around Jeju Island have recently undergone rapid growth in numbers, with negative impacts on local biodiversity. However, it is unclear whether these Korean populations occurred historically and where they originate from. In this study, we investigated the phylogenetic relationships of A. japonica along with its endosymbiont Symbiodiniaceae across five geographic regions, including Jeju Island in Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. Nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences revealed unexpected species-level divergence among three distinct phylogenetic clusters (Korea, Taiwan, and Japan) with no sharing of haplotypes among lineages, suggesting these may each represent cryptic species in Alveopora. 23S ribosomal DNA of Symbiodiniaceae showed two well-separated phylogenetic clusters, in which Korean and Japanese symbionts shared the same clade and Taiwanese ones formed a distinct clade. Given the deep phylogenetic divergences among the lineages for both corals and Symbiodiniaceae, the Korean populations appear to have existed for a long evolutionary time period rather than representing a poleward migration from subtropical environments following recent climate change. Our study highlights cryptic species diversity in Alveopora at high-latitude environments.

Our goals were to characterize spatial and temporal genetic variation and determine the effects of fishing on an exploited reef fish, Plectropomus leopardus, Lacepede (the common coral trout). To determine population structure, we genotyped 417 Great Barrier Reef coral trout from four populations sampled in 2 years (1996 and 2004) at nine microsatellite loci. To test for exploitation effects, we additionally genotyped 869 individuals from a single cohort (ages 3-5) across eight different reefs, including fished and control populations. Genetic structure differed substantially in the two sampled years, with only 1 year exhibiting isolation by distance. Thus, genetic drift likely plays a role in shaping population genetic structure in this species. Although we found no loss of genetic diversity associated with exploitation, our relatedness patterns show that pulse fishing likely affects population genetics. Additionally, genetic structure in the cohort samples likely reflected spatial variation in recruitment contributing to genetic structure at the population level. Overall, we show that fishing does impact coral reef fishes, highlighting the importance of repeated widespread sampling to accurately characterize the genetic structure of reef fishes, as well as the power of analysing cohorts to avoid the impacts of recruitment-related genetic swamping. The high temporal and spatial variability in genetic structure, combined with possible selection effects, will make conservation/management of reef fish species complex.

Moreover, both are viviparous with similar reproductive strategies and with a gregarious larval behavior. Samples of both species from the Brazilian coast were analyzed using 18 isozymic loci to quantify their genetic variability and populational structure. Results confirmed species identity, high intrapopulational variability and revealed moderate genetic structuring among all samples (S. stellata: F-ST = 0.070; S. radians: F-ST = 0.092). Based on genotypic diversity analysis, there was evidence that local recruitment may have a minor role in the populations (mean, G(o) :G(e) = 1.00 +/- 0.0003 SD for S. stellata and 0.99 +/- 0.0023 SD for S. radians). Deviations towards heterozygote deficiencies found in both Siderastrea species could be explained by the Wahlund effect, since there was evidence that populations might be composed of colonies of different ages. In S. radians it is also likely that there is some inbreeding occurring in the studied populations. Despite the brooding pattern and the gregarious larval behavior, our data suggest the occurrence of gene flow along the Brazilian coast. This is the first study on population genetics of Brazilian reef corals.

The genetic patterns we observed followed isolation by environment, where nearshore and adjacent offshore populations showed significant genetic structure at both locations (AMOVA F-ST = 0.04 similar to 0.19, P < 0.001), but no significant isolation by distance between islands. Strikingly, corals from the two nearshore sites with higher levels of environmental stressors on different islands over 100 km apart with similar environmentally stressful conditions were genetically closer (F-ST = 0.0, P = 0.73) than those within a single location less than 2 km apart (F-ST = 0.04 similar to 0.08, P < 0.01). In contrast, a third site with a less impacted nearshore site (i.e., less pronounced environmental gradient) showed no significant structure from the offshore comparison. Our results show much stronger support for environment than distance separating these populations. Our finding suggests that ecological boundaries from human impacts may play a role in forming genetic structure in the coastal environment, and that genetic divergence in the absence of geographical barriers to gene flow might be explained by selective pressure across contrasting habitats.

Phylogeography of Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems: Squirrelfish and Soldierfish (Holocentriformes: Holocentridae)	DIVERSITY-BASEL			English	Article						mesophotic coral ecosystems; biodiversity; coalescent; coral reefs; deep reef refugia; fishes; mtDNA; population structure; vertebrates	POPULATION-GENETICS; REEF FISHES; MARINE; TELEOSTEI; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS; SHALLOW; DNA; CONNECTIVITY; HISTORIES	Mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs: similar to 30 to 100+ m depth) may be older and more stable than shallow coral ecosystems that are more prone to disturbances in both the long term (glacial sea level cycles) and short term (heavy weather and anthropogenic activities). Here, we assess the phylogeography of two MCE fishes, the soldierfish Myripristis chryseres (N = 85) and the squirrelfish Neoniphon aurolineatus (N = 74), with mtDNA cytochrome oxidase C subunit I. Our goal is to resolve population genetic diversity across the Central and West Pacific and compare these patterns to three shallow-reef species in the same taxonomic family (Holocentridae). Significant population structure (phi(ST) = 0.148, p = 0.01) was observed in N. aurolineatus, while no structure was detected in M. chryseres (phi(ST) = -0.031, p = 0.83), a finding that matches the shallow-water congener M. berndti (phi(ST) = -0.007, p = 0.63) across the same range. Nucleotide diversity in the MCE fishes was low (pi = 0.0024-0.0028) compared to shallow counterparts (pi = 0.003-0.006). Coalescence times calculated for M. chryseres (similar to 272,000 years) and N. aurolineatus (similar to 284,000 years) are more recent or comparable to the shallow-water holocentrids (similar to 220,000-916,000 years). We conclude that the shallow genetic coalescence characteristic of shallow-water marine fishes cannot be attributed to frequent disturbance. We see no evidence from holocentrid species that MCEs are older or more stable habitats.	[Copus, Joshua M.; Walsh, Cameron A.

After completing their development, larvae crawl and settle near maternal colonies. Here we study the genetic polymorphism of developing larvae by the use of amplified fragment-length polymorphism markers. Four reproductive colonies from shallow water populations (two from a dense population and two from a less densely populated area 100 m away) were chosen, and ten larvae were randomly collected from each colony. DNA was analyzed by using three different primer combinations producing 61, 63, 63 polymorphic markers, respectively. All larvae exhibited different banding patterns from one another, illustrating the prominent role of sexual reproduction for the production of larvae. Nei's mean genetic distances for all 12 possible pair-wise combinations for larval origins revealed, in most cases, that sister larvae are genetically closer than larvae from different colonies and that larvae may be grouped into three statistical clusters in accordance with colony origin and population studied. The usefulness of molecular methodologies in coral population genetics is discussed.

Phylogeography of commercial tuna and mackerel in the Indonesian Archipelago	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article							CORAL-REEF FISH; POPULATION GENETIC-STRUCTURE; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA ANALYSIS; INDIAN SCAD MACKEREL; BORING GIANT CLAM; BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS; STATISTICAL TESTS; INDO-PACIFIC; GLOBAL PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; MARINE BIODIVERSITY	While numerous population genetics studies have investigated phylogeographic patterns of coral reef organisms in the Coral Triangle, few have addressed whether fishes in the pelagic environment exhibit concordant patterns of genetic subdivision. We analyzed approximately 400 base pairs of the mitochondrial control region to compare population structure and phylogeography of five pelagic tuna and mackerel within a subset of their geographic ranges (i.e., the Indonesian Archipelago). Focal species include frigate tuna [Auxis thazard (Lacepede, 1800)], kawakawa [Euthynnus affinis (Cantor, 1849)], skipjack tuna [Katsuwonus pelamis (Linnaeus, 1758)], Indian mackerel [Rastrelliger kanagurta (Cuvier, 1816)], and narrow-barred Spanish mackerel [Scomberomorus commerson (Lacepede, 1800)]. Observed patterns of regional genetic subdivision were consistent with the role of Pleistocene vicariance in structuring populations. Divergence dates of all pelagic fish lineages dated to the Pleistocene epoch. Concordant barriers to larval dispersal found near Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Papua suggested that the Halmahera and Mindanao eddies and the Indonesian flowthrough may be contemporary forces maintaining genetic divergence between demes of pelagic fishes. Given the economic importance of these species, we suggest that the scale of management for pelagics in Indonesia be re-evaluated to reflect regional differences in the genetic composition of fishes.

Recent origin and semi-permeable species boundaries in the scleractinian coral genus Stylophora from the Red Sea	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; POPULATION-GENETICS; INDIAN-OCEAN; REEF; POCILLOPORA; DIVERSITY; PISTILLATA; HYBRIDIZATION; EVOLUTION; SOFTWARE	Reticulate evolution, introgressive hybridisation, and phenotypic plasticity have been documented in scleractinian corals and have challenged our ability to interpret speciation processes. Stylophora is a key model system in coral biology and physiology, but genetic analyses have revealed that cryptic lineages concealed by morphological stasis exist in the Stylophora pistillata species complex. The Red Sea represents a hotspot for Stylophora biodiversity with six morphospecies described, two of which are regionally endemic. We investigated Stylophora species boundaries from the Red Sea and the associated Symbiodinium by sequencing seven DNA loci. Stylophora morphospecies from the Red Sea were not resolved based on mitochondrial phylogenies and showed nuclear allele sharing. Low genetic differentiation, weak isolation, and strong gene flow were found among morphospecies although no signals of genetic recombination were evident among them. Stylophora mamillata harboured Symbiodinium clade C whereas the other two Stylophora morphospecies hosted either Symbiodinium clade A or C. These evolutionary patterns suggest that either gene exchange occurs through reticulate evolution or that multiple ecomorphs of a phenotypically plastic species occur in the Red Sea. The recent origin of the lineage leading to the Red Sea Stylophora may indicate an ongoing speciation driven by environmental changes and incomplete lineage sorting.

Phylogeography and Limited Genetic Connectivity in the Endangered Boring Giant Clam across the Coral Triangle	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						coral triangle; genetic connectivity; Indo-Pacific; larval dispersal; marine protected areas; population genetics; Tridacna crocea	LINCKIA-LAEVIGATA; SEA LEVELS; PACIFIC; DNA; POPULATIONS; DIVERGENCE; FLOW; MITOCHONDRIAL; STOMATOPODS; PHYLOGENY	The Coral Triangle is the global center of marine biodiversity; however, its coral reefs arc, critically threatened. Because of The bipartite life history of many marine species with sedentary adults and dispersive pelagic larvae, designing effective marine protected areas requires an understanding of patterns of larval dispersal and connectivity among geographically discrete populations. We used mtDNA sequence data to examine patterns of genetic connectivity in the boring giant clam (Tridacna crocea) in an effort to guide conservation efforts within the Coral Triangle. We collected an approximately 485 base pair fragment of mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase 1 (CO1) from 414 individuals at 26 sites across Indonesia. Genetic structure was strong between regions (phi(ST) = 0.549, p < 0.00001) with 3 strongly supported clades: one restricted to western Sumatra, another distributed across central Indonesia, and a third limited to eastern Indonesia and Papua. Even within the single largest clade, small but significant genetic structure was documented (phi(ST) = 0.069, p < 0.00001), which indicates limited gene flow within and among phylogeographic regions. Significant patterns of isolation by distance indicated an average dispersal distance of only 25-50 km, which is far below dispersal predictions of 406-708 km derived from estimates of passive dispersal over 10 days via surface currents. The strong regional genetic structure we found indicates potent limits to genetic and demographic connectivity for this species throughout the Coral Triangle and provides a regional context for conservation planning. The recovery of 3 distinct evolutionarily significant units within a well-studied taxonomic group suggests that biodiversity in this region may be significantly underestimated and that Tridacna taxa may be more endangered than currently recognized.

They are corallivorous and prey almost exclusively on living coral tissues. Over the past decade there have been reports of population outbreaks of Drupell on several reefs in the tropical Indo-West Pacific region (Japan, the Philippines, the Marshall Islands, Western Australia). These high densities of snails appear to have been responsible for extensive and significant coral mortality on a scale which has previously only been documented for the crown-of-thorns starfish Acanthaster planci. At Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia, where the outbreak has been on a greater temporal and spatial scale than has so far been documented elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific region, it is estimated that live coral cover in the back-reef areas may have been reduced by more than 75%. The implications of such extensive coral mortality for the reefs population, community and ecosystem structure and function, and the ramifications of such changes in ecological, evolutionary and geomorphological terms are unknown. The available information regarding the reproduction, early life history, feeding biology, growth and longevity, mortality and population genetics of Drupella is reviewed and areas where further research is required are identified. The history of the outbreaks is reviewed, and the possible causes examined. Both anthropogenic (increased terrestrial run-off, over-fishing and increased reef damage) and natural (variable larval recruitment) causes have been proposed to explain the outbreaks. There is insufficient information available at present to enable any of the alternative hypotheses to be objectively assessed. Information on the effects of Drupella outbreaks on coral reefs and reef recovery following outbreaks are described and the management issues associated with these outbreaks are discussed. There are conflicting views regarding the significance of outbreaks of Drupella, and consequently, the desirability and feasibility of implementing appropriate management responses.

Genetic structure of Orbicella faveolata population reveals high connectivity among a marine protected area and Varadero Reef in the Colombian Caribbean	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						conservation; coral reefs; genetic diversity; marine; National Natural Park; protected area; Scleractinia	CORAL MONTASTRAEA-ANNULARIS; MOUNTAINOUS STAR CORAL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DIFFERENTIATION; CONSEQUENCES; CONSERVATION; RESILIENCE; DIVERSITY; SOFTWARE; SYSTEM	The protection of ecosystems with high diversity, such as coral reefs, is not an approach that guarantees their conservation. Thus, maintaining connectivity among coral populations over the long term is a strategy that should be adopted in order to protect diversity and ecological processes. Although coral reefs in Colombia are highly diverse, the population genetics baseline data of keystone species such as Orbicella faveolata are limited. To provide current information about the connectivity between populations of O. faveolata in the Colombian Caribbean, the genetic diversity and distribution of O. faveolata was evaluated with analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), principal components, and migration estimations using 113 genets distributed in six populations. Also, a genetic structure analysis that included the available data for the Caribbean population was conducted, seeking to understand how the Colombian populations relate to the broader region. According to the global fixation index (F-ST) for the Colombian Caribbean, there was no genetic structure (F-ST = 0.002). Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) showed that Corales del Rosario Archipelago (CR), Este de Isla Fuerte (EIF), San Bernardo Archipelago (SB), and Varadero Reef (VR) were grouped with Oeste de Isla Fuerte (OIF), with Bushnell (BS) representing the most divergent cluster. Migration analysis showed relatively high migration from VR to CR and SB, highlighting the importance of VR as a genetic reservoir for the region. Structure analysis showed that the Colombian population presented a specific genetic identity (F-ST = 0.254), suggesting that the Colombian Caribbean population could be a peripheral population that contributes significantly to genetic variation and is connected through a complex connectivity process. In conclusion, the estimated genetic connectivity reflects the influence of sea surface dynamics over the interpopulation exchange dynamics and the role of protected and nonprotected coral reef in the Colombian Caribbean. Thus, the Colombian Caribbean population of O. faveolata could be relevant to the conservation of genetic diversity on a larger scale.

Screening of at least 17 individuals showed these markers to be polymorphic with observed heterozygosity ranging from 0.381 to 1.000 (mean = 0.742) and the numbers of alleles ranging from three to 18. The average polymorphic information content for these eight loci was 0.723. These markers may be used for parentage studies aimed at exploring the complex mating strategies employed by this haremic coral reef fish and will be valuable for population genetic studies.

Population structure and dispersal of the coral-excavating sponge Cliona delitrix	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						Caribbean Sea; connectivity; coral death; marine sponge; population genetics	FLORIDA REEF TRACT; SPIN-OFF EDDIES; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; MARINE SPONGE; NULL ALLELES; MICROSATELLITE LOCI; BORING SPONGES; CARIBBEAN SPONGE; CRAMBE-CRAMBE; TORTUGAS GYRE	Some excavating sponges of the genus Cliona compete with live reef corals, often killing and bioeroding entire colonies. Important aspects affecting distribution of these species, such as dispersal capability and population structure, remain largely unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine levels of genetic connectivity and dispersal of Cliona delitrix across the Greater Caribbean (Caribbean Sea, Bahamas and Florida), to understand current patterns and possible future trends in their distribution and effects on coral reefs. Using ten species-specific microsatellite markers, we found high levels of genetic differentiation between six genetically distinct populations: one in the Atlantic (Florida-Bahamas), one specific to Florida and four in the South Caribbean Sea. In Florida, two independent breeding populations are likely separated by depth. Gene flow and ecological dispersal occur among other populations in the Florida reef tract, and between some Florida locations and the Bahamas. Similarly, gene flow occurs between populations in the South Caribbean Sea, but appears restricted between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic (Florida-Bahamas). Dispersal of C.delitrix was farther than expected for a marine sponge and favoured in areas where currents are strong enough to transport sponge eggs or larvae over longer distances. Our results support the influence of ocean current patterns on genetic connectivity, and constitute a baseline to monitor future C. delitrix trends under climate change.

The recent and ongoing interest about neutral assumptions has produced many developments on the theoretical side, with nevertheless limited echoes in terms of analyses of real-world data. The present review paper aims to help bridge the widening gap between modellers and field ecologists through two objectives. First, to provide a multi-criteria typology of the main neutral models, including those from population genetics that have not yet been transposed to ecology, by considering how the fundamental processes of ecological drift, speciation and migration are modelled and, specifically, how space is taken into account. Second, to review methods recently proposed to estimate models parameters from field data, a point that should be mastered to allow for broader applications. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In total, 293 planulae and 10 adult colonies were analyzed. In June 2006, 147 planulae were collected from 10 shallow water colonies. In March, April and June 2007, 146 additional planulae were sampled from five of the ten 2006 sampled colonies. All AFLP products showed unalike band profiles indicating a fully sexual production pattern. We used 181 and 210 putative AFLP loci, of which the overall level of polymorphism in 2006 was 92 and 99 % in 2007 (respectively). Differences were also observed between 2006 and 2007 reproductive seasons in terms of total average gene diversity (0.191 vs. 0.247, respectively), suggesting fast turnover of sperm donor genotypes. In addition, increased numbers of potential sperm donor colonies in the vicinity of gravid females showed no impact on genetic differentiation levels in released larvae. UPGMA tree revealed clustering of maternal genotypes and their offspring, suggesting, as expected, high relatedness between planulae and their mothers. In addition, the average heterozygosity of each group of siblings was persistently lower than heterozygosity calculated for the respective maternal colony, suggesting the possibility of partial inbreeding. This trend of reduced genetic heterogeneity in Stylophora pistillata is an alarming sign for populations residing in the northern Red Sea coral reefs.

BIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL INTERACTIONS ON A TROPICAL ISLAND CORAL REEF TRANSPORT AND RETENTION PROCESSES ON MOOREA, FRENCH POLYNESIA	OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; SELF-RECRUITMENT; FISH; NUTRIENT; LAGOON; SCALE; OCEAN; FLOW; RECTIFICATION; CIRCULATION	The Moorea Coral Reef Long Term Ecological Research project funded by the US National Science Foundation includes multidisciplinary studies of physical processes driving ecological dynamics across the fringing reef, back reef, and fore reef habitats of Moorea, French Polynesia. A network of oceanographic moorings and a variety of other approaches have been used to investigate the biological and biogeochemical aspects of water transport and retention processes in this system. There is evidence to support the hypothesis that a low-frequency counterclockwise flow around the island is superimposed on the relatively strong alongshore currents on each side of the island. Despite the rapid flow and flushing of the back reef, waters over the reef display chemical and biological characteristics distinct from those offshore. The patterns include higher nutrient and lower dissolved organic carbon concentrations, distinct microbial community compositions among habitats, and reef assemblages of zooplankton that exhibit migration behavior, suggesting multigenerational residence on the reef. Zooplankton consumption by planktivorous fish on the reef reflects both retention of reef-associated taxa and capture by the reef community of resources originating offshore. Coral recruitment and population genetics of reef fishes point to retention of larvae within the system and high recruitment levels from local adult populations. The combined results suggest that a broad suite of physical and biological processes contribute to high retention of externally derived and locally produced organic materials within this island coral reef system.

J	ORIVE, ME				ORIVE, ME			SENESCENCE IN ORGANISMS WITH CLONAL REPRODUCTION AND COMPLEX LIFE-HISTORIES	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article							POPULATION-DYNAMICS; AGE; CORAL; DEMOGRAPHY; PARAMETERS	A population genetics model is developed predicting the fate of alleles affecting life-history attributes in organisms with complex life histories, including clonal reproduction and indeterminate growth. Such organisms are widespread and found in many ecologically important groups, including marine invertebrates such as corals and sponges, and most higher plant taxa. The evolution of senescence (here defined as a decrease in fitness components with age or stage) by the action of alleles having negatively pleiotropic stage effects is investigated in such organisms. The spread of these alleles depends on the sensitivity of the population growth rate, a measure of fitness, to changes in life-history parameters that for this model are the entries of the stage transition matrix. Examples from a published demographic study show that, for several cases examined, alleles increasing early survival or early reproduction at the cost of decreased late survival will not be favored. Clonal reproduction acts to retard the evolution of senescence, although by itself the existence of clonal reproduction in an organism does not preclude the evolution of senescence.

Genomic analysis of distinct bleaching tolerances among cryptic coral species	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						coral bleaching; ecological genomics; cryptic species	ADAPTIVE INTROGRESSION; POPULATION-GENETICS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SPECIATION; DIVERSITY; SELECTION; ISLANDS; FUTURE	Reef-building coral species are experiencing an unprecedented decline owing to increasing frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves and associated bleaching-induced mortality. Closely related species from the Acropora hyacinthus species complex differ in heat tolerance and in their association with heat-tolerant symbionts. We used low-coverage full genome sequencing of 114 colonies monitored across the 2015 bleaching event in American Samoa to determine the genetic differences among four cryptic species (termed HA, HC, HD and HE) that have diverged in these species traits. Cryptic species differed strongly at thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms across the genome which are enriched for amino acid changes in the bleaching-resistant species HE. In addition, HE also showed two particularly divergent regions with strong signals of differentiation. One approximately 220 kb locus, HES1, contained the majority of fixed differences in HE. A second locus, HES2, was fixed in HE but polymorphic in the other cryptic species. Surprisingly, non-HE individuals with HE-like haplotypes at HES2 were more likely to bleach. At both loci, HE showed particular sequence similarity to a congener, Acropora millepora. Overall, resilience to bleaching during the third global bleaching event was strongly structured by host cryptic species, buoyed by differences in symbiont associations between these species.

Seascape genetics: A coupled oceanographic-genetic model predicts population structure of Caribbean corals	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							MARINE POPULATIONS; LARVAL DISPERSAL; FLOW; CONNECTIVITY; RETENTION; EVOLUTION; MIGRATION; PATTERNS; DISTANCE; SCALE	Population genetics is a powerful tool for measuring important larval connections between marine populations [1-4]. Similarly, oceanographic models based on environmental data can simulate particle movements in ocean currents and make quantitative estimates of larval connections between populations possible [5-9]. However, these two powerful approaches have remained disconnected because no general models currently provide a means of directly comparing dispersal predictions with empirical genetic data (except, see [10]). In addition, previous genetic models have considered relatively simple dispersal scenarios that are often unrealistic for marine larvae [11-15], and recent landscape genetic models have yet to be applied in a marine context [16-20]. We have developed a genetic model that uses connectivity estimates from oceanographic models to predict genetic patterns resulting from larval dispersal in a Caribbean coral. We then compare the predictions to empirical data for threatened staghorn corals. Our coupled oceanographic-genetic model predicts many of the patterns observed in this and other empirical datasets; such patterns include the isolation of the Bahamas and an east-west divergence near Puerto Rico [3, 21-23]. This new approach provides both a valuable tool for predicting genetic structure in marine populations and a means of explicitly testing these predictions with empirical data (Figure 1).

The entire mitochondrial genome of H. melapterus is 16,527 base pairs (bp) in length and contained 13 protein-coding genes, two rRNA genes, and 22 tRNA genes. The overall base composition is 27.56% A, 25.58% T, 30.02% C, and 16.85% G, showing AT-rich feature (53.14%). Phylogenetic analysis based on 13 protein-coding genes shows the H. melapterus has the closest evolutionary relationship with Stethojulis strigiventer. This work provides valuable genome variation information, which will be useful for phylogenetic analysis and population genetics research.

Large-scale biogeographic patterns are reflected in the genetic structure of a broadcast spawning stony coral	CORAL REEFS			English	Article						Connectivity; Coral reef; Gene flow; Population genetics; Western Indian Ocean	POPULATION-STRUCTURE; ACROPORA-TENUIS; REEF; CONNECTIVITY; FLOW; DISPERSAL; DIVERSITY; COASTAL; CONSERVATION; CIRCULATION	Countries in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) and along the Red Sea are particularly vulnerable to coral reef degradation, and understanding the degree of connectivity among coral reefs is a first step toward efficient conservation. The aim of this study is to investigate the genetic diversity, population structure and connectivity patterns of the broadcast spawning coral Acropora tenuis, first at a large scale comparing the Red Sea and the WIO, and second at a smaller scale comparing sites within the WIO. In total 689 individual A. tenuis colonies were sampled on 28 locations in Saudi Arabia, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and Madagascar and analysed with seven microsatellite markers. The sample site in the Red Sea was found to be differentiated from all other sites in the WIO, which confirms the hypothesised genetic break. High differentiation was found between the African mainland and Madagascar and within Madagascar. However, there is evidence for long-distance larval dispersal for A. tenuis in the North Mozambique Channel region, with exchange between northern Mozambique and northern Madagascar. The sites in the southwest of Madagascar show mixing with sites in northern Madagascar, as well as exchange with sites in northern Mozambique and Tanzania. Southern Mozambique forms a separate group in Bayesian clustering. High genetic connectivity was found for most sites along the East African mainland coast, with no indication for strict genetic barriers. These results support biophysical modelling studies, which propose Tanzania as a seeding source of larvae for downstream Kenya. These patterns of high genetic connectivity combined with contemporary dispersal barriers can be explained by the long larval duration of A. tenuis and the prevailing northbound East African Coast Current that facilitates higher genetic connectivity along the northern East African Coast, while eddies in the Mozambique Channel are causing larval retention in southern Mozambique and Madagascar.

Population Genetics of an Ecosystem-Defining Reef Coral Pocillopora damicornis in the Tropical Eastern Pacific	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION ANALYSIS; LARVAL DISPERSAL; GENOTYPIC DIVERSITY; BROODING CORAL; EL-NINO; PLANT-POPULATIONS; PERIPHERAL-POPULATIONS; BALANOPHYLLIA-ELEGANS; CONSERVATION GENETICS	Background: Coral reefs in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) are amongst the most peripheral and geographically isolated in the world. This isolation has shaped the biology of TEP organisms and lead to the formation of numerous endemic species. For example, the coral Pocillopora damicornis is a minor reef-builder elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific, but is the dominant reef-building coral in the TEP, where it forms large, mono-specific stands, covering many hectares of reef. Moreover, TEP P. damicornis reproduces by broadcast spawning, while it broods mostly parthenogenetic larvae throughout the rest of the Indo-West Pacific. Population genetic surveys for P. damicornis from across its Indo-Pacific range indicate that gene flow (i.e. larval dispersal) is generally limited over hundreds of kilometers or less. Little is known about the population genetic structure and the dispersal potential of P. damicornis in the TEP. Methodology: Using multilocus microsatellite data, we analyzed the population structure of TEP P. damicornis among and within nine reefs and test for significant genetic structure across three geographically and ecologically distinct regions in Panama. Principal Findings/Conclusions: We detected significant levels of population genetic structure (global R-ST = 0.162), indicating restricted gene flow (i.e. larvae dispersal), both among the three regions (R-RT = 0.081) as well as within regions (R-SR = 0.089). Limited gene flow across a distinct environmental cline, like the regional upwelling gradient in Panama, indicates a significant potential for differential adaptation and population differentiation. Individual reefs were characterized by unexpectedly high genet diversity (avg. 94%), relatively high inbreeding coefficients (global F-IS = 0.183), and localized spatial genetic structure among individuals (i.e. unique genets) over 10 m intervals. These findings suggest that gene flow is limited in TEP P. damicornis populations, particularly among regions, but even over meter scales within populations.

While strong patterns of host specificity have been observed consistently in sponge microbiomes, the precise ecological relationships between hosts and their symbiotic microbial communities remain to be fully delineated. In the current study, we investigate the relative roles of host population genetics and biogeography in structuring the microbial communities hosted by the excavating sponge Cliona delitrix. A total of 53 samples, previously used to demarcate the population genetic structure of C. delitrix, were selected from two locations in the Caribbean Sea and from eight locations across the reefs of Florida and the Bahamas. Microbial community diversity and composition were measured using Illumina-based high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA V4 region and related to host population structure and geographic distribution. Most operational taxonomic units (OTUs) specific to Cliona delitrix microbiomes were rare, while other OTUs were shared with congeneric hosts. Across a large regional scale (>1,000 km), geographic distance was associated with considerable variability of the sponge microbiome, suggesting a distance-decay relationship, but little impact over smaller spatial scales (<300 km) was observed. Host population structure had a moderate effect on the structure of these microbial communities, regardless of geographic distance. These results support the interplay between geographic, environmental, and host factors as forces determining the community structure of microbiomes associated with C. delitrix. Moreover, these data suggest that the mechanisms of host regulation can be observed at the population genetic scale, prior to the onset of speciation.

Location Indo-West Pacific, notably including two suture zones: Socotra and Christmas and Cocos/Keeling Islands. Taxon Chromis dimidiata, Chromis margaritifer, and Chromis fieldi. Methods We utilized a combination of nuclear and mitochondrial genetic markers in addition to visual abundance survey data of these fishes. Results Despite genetic patterns consistent with incomplete lineage sorting and relatively low genetic differentiation among the three studied Chromis species, there is evidence of hybridization between C. margaritifer and C. fieldi at Christmas Island based on molecular and visual identification. Introgression appears to be spreading westwards to other C. fieldi populations based on COI haplotype comparison. Moreover, the genetic distance between C. margaritifer and C. fieldi suggests that Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations may have contributed to allopatric divergence and secondary contact between these two closely related species. Main conclusions Our study highlights that evolutionary processes in coral reef fishes operate differently between suture zones, possibly due to different ecological and environmental predispositions regulating secondary contact of sister species. While secondary contact likely led to hybridization and introgression at Christmas and Cocos/Keeling Islands, none of those processes seem present at Socotra for the chocolate-dipped damselfish. This difference is likely due to an environmental barrier caused by hydrodynamic regimes in the Gulf of Aden.

J	Gilmour, JP				Gilmour, JP			Substantial asexual recruitment of mushroom corals contributes little to population genetics of adults in conditions of chronic sedimentation	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						corals; fungiid; Fungia fungites; sex; asexual reproduction; electrophoresis; coral recruitment; Dampier; Archipelago	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; FLOW; REPRODUCTION; REGENERATION; FECUNDITY; ABUNDANCE	The contribution of asexual versus sexual recruitment to populations of the mushroom coral Fungia fungites was investigated at 2 sites with contrasting sediment regimes, located 5 km apart in the Dampier Archipelago (Western Australia), One site was exposed to high levels of chronic sedimentation, and many of its F. fungites polyps were asexual buds attached to dead parent polyps. A total of 95 buds were sampled from 26 parent skeletons; all buds on each parent were of the same genotype. The second site received less than half the sediment load, and the F. fungites polyps there were not observed to produce asexual buds. I hypothesised that asexual and sexual recruitment would contribute disproportionately to the maintenance of the high- and low-sediment sites respectively. However, electrophoretic analysis of 7 polymorphic loci indicated that sexual recruitment was responsible for the majority of adults in a random sample (n = 120) of polyps from each site. All polyps sampled at the low-sediment site had unique 7 locus genotypes. Between 10 and 30% of the polyps at the sediment-affected site were derived asexually, but all were in juvenile size classes, usually as replicate buds attached to a single parent. No adult polyps shared the same genotype, despite evidence that rarely, some asexual recruits may survive to adult size. Patterns of sexual recruitment underlying both populations were characterised by major heterozygote deficiencies and considerable inbreeding (F-IS = 0,571 +/- 0.018 SE). Most genetic differentiation occurred between locations within sites (F-ST = 0.080) rather that among sites (F-ST = 0.022). Dispersal of gametes and larvae appear to be highly localised.

We provide an accessible overview of the latest developments in seascape genetics that merge exciting new ideas from the field of marine population connectivity with statistical and technical advances in population genetics. After summarizing the historical context leading to the emergence of seascape genetics, we detail questions and methodological approaches that are evolving the discipline, highlight applications to conservation and management, and conclude with a summary of the field's transition to seascape genomics. From 100 seascape genetic studies, we assess trends in taxonomic and geographic coverage, sampling and statistical design, and dominant seascape drivers. Notably, temperature, oceanography and geography show equal prevalence of influence on spatial genetic patterns, and tests of over 20 other seascape factors suggest that a variety of forces impact connectivity at distinct spatio-temporal scales. A new level of rigor in statistical analysis is critical for disentangling multiple drivers and spurious effects. Coupled with GIS data and genomic scale sequencing methods, this rigor is taking seascape genetics beyond an initial focus on identifying correlations to hypothesis-driven insights into patterns and processes of population connectivity and adaptation. The latest studies are illuminating differences between demographic, functional and neutral genetic connectivity, and informing applications to marine reserve design, fisheries science and strategies to assess resilience to climate change and other anthropogenic impacts.

Larval connectivity patterns of the North Indo-West Pacific coral reefs	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; POPULATION GENETIC-STRUCTURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SELF-RECRUITMENT; DISPERSAL; CIRCULATION; FISH; CONSERVATION; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS	Coral reefs of the North Indo-West Pacific provide important ecosystem services to the region but are subjected to multiple local and global threats. Strengthening management measures necessitate understanding the variability of larval connectivity and bridging global connectivity models to local scales. An individual-based Lagrangian biophysical model was used to simulate connectivity between coral reefs for three organisms with different early life history characteristics: a coral (Acropora millepora), a sea urchin (Tripneustes gratilla), and a reef fish (Epinephelussp). Connectivity metrics and reef clusters were computed from the settlement probability matrices. Fitted power law functions derived from the dispersal kernels provided relative probabilities of connection given only the distance between reefs, and demonstrated that 95% of the larvae across organisms settled within a third of their maximum settlement distances. The magnitude of the connectivity metric values of reef cells were sensitive to differences both in the type of organism and temporal variability. Seasonal variability of connections was more dominant than interannual variability. However, despite these differences, the moderate to high correlation of metrics between organisms and seasonal matrices suggest that the spatial patterns are relatively similar between reefs. A cluster analysis based on the Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity of sink and source connections synthesized the inherent variability of these multiple large connectivity matrices. Through this, similarities in regional connectivity patterns were determined at various cluster sizes depending on the scale of interest. The validity of the model is supported by 1) the simulated dispersal kernels being within the range of reported parentage analysis estimates; and, 2) the clusters that emerged reflect the dispersal barriers implied by previously published population genetics studies. The tools presented here (dispersal kernels, temporal variability maps and reef clustering) can be used to include regional patterns of connectivity into the spatial management of coral reefs.

The main limitation that prevents the implementation of adequate conservation measures is that connectivity and genetic structure of populations are poorly known. Here, the genetic diversity and connectivity of the brooding scleractinian coral Seriatopora hystrix were assessed at two scales by genotyping ten microsatellite markers for 356 individual colonies. S. hystrix showed high differentiation, both at large scale between the Red Sea and the Western Indian Ocean (WIO), and at smaller scale along the coast of East Africa. As such high levels of differentiation might indicate the presence of more than one species, a haploweb analysis was conducted with the nuclear marker ITS2, confirming that the Red Sea populations are genetically distinct from the WIO ones. Based on microsatellite analyses three groups could be distinguished within the WIO: (1) northern Madagascar, (2) south-west Madagascar together with one site in northern Mozambique (Nacala) and (3) all other sites in northern Mozambique, Tanzania and Kenya. These patterns of restricted connectivity could be explained by the short pelagic larval duration of S. hystrix, and/or by oceanographic factors, such as eddies in the Mozambique Channel (causing larval retention in northern Madagascar but facilitating dispersal from northern Mozambique towards south-west Madagascar). This study provides an additional line of evidence supporting the conservation priority status of the Northern Mozambique Channel and should inform coral reef management decisions in the region.

Microsatellite allele sizes alone are insufficient to delineate species boundaries in Symbiodinium	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Editorial Material						microsatellites; population genetics; species boundaries; Symbiodinium	CORAL-ALGAL SYMBIOSIS; PACIFIC GIANT CLAMS; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; SEA FAN CORAL; GENETIC DIVERSITY; SP NOV.; VECTORED INTRODUCTIONS; SCLERACTINIAN CORALS; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; CLADE-D	Symbiodinium are a diverse group of unicellular dinoflagellates that are important nutritional symbionts of reefbuilding corals. Symbiodinium putative species ('types') are commonly identified with genetic markers, mostly nuclear and chloroplast encoded ribosomal DNA regions. Population genetic analyses using microsatellite loci have provided insights into Symbiodinium biogeography, connectivity and phenotypic plasticity, but are complicated by: (i) a lack of consensus criteria used to delineate inter- vs. intragenomic variation within species; and (ii) the high density of Symbiodinium in host tissues, which results in single samples comprising thousands of individuals. To address this problem, Wham & LaJeunesse (2016) present a method for identifying cryptic Symbiodinium species from microsatellite data based on correlations between allele size distributions and nongeographic genetic structure. Multilocus genotypes that potentially do not recombine in sympatry are interpreted as secondary 'species' to be discarded from downstream population genetic analyses. However, Symbiodinium species delineations should ideally incorporate multiple physiological, ecological and molecular criteria. This is because recombination tests may be a poor indicator of species boundaries in Symbiodinium due to their predominantly asexual mode of reproduction. Furthermore, discontinuous microsatellite allele sizes in sympatry may be explained by secondary contact between previously isolated populations and by mutations that occur in a non-stepwise manner. Limitations of using microsatellites alone to delineate species are highlighted in earlier studies that demonstrate occasional bimodal distributions of allele sizes within Symbiodinium species and considerable allele size sharing among Symbiodinium species. We outline these issues and discuss the validity of reinterpretations of our previously published microsatellite data from Symbiodinium populations on the Great Barrier Reef (Howells et al. 2013).

The red coral (Corallium rubrum) transcriptome: a new resource for population genetics and local adaptation studies	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES			English	Article						cnidarians; gene expression; local adaptation; octocoral polymorphism; transcriptome	DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS; RNA-SEQ; CELL BIOLOGY; GENES; IDENTIFICATION; POLYMORPHISMS; ENVIRONMENT; DISCOVERY; FRAMEWORK; EVOLUTION	The question of species survival and evolution in heterogeneous environments has long been a subject for study. Indeed, it is often difficult to identify the molecular basis of adaptation to contrasted environments, and nongenetic effects increase the difficulty to disentangle fixed effects, such as genetic adaptation, from variable effects, such as individual phenotypic plasticity, in adaptation. Nevertheless, this question is also of great importance for understanding the evolution of species in a context of climate change. The red coral (Corallium rubrum) lives in the Mediterranean Sea, where at depths ranging from 5 to 600m, it meets very contrasted thermal conditions. The shallowest populations of this species suffered from mortality events linked with thermal anomalies that have highlighted thermotolerance differences between individuals. We provide here a new transcriptomic resource, as well as candidate markers for the study of local adaptation. We sequenced the transcriptome of six individuals from 5m and six individuals from 40m depth at the same site of the Marseilles bay, after a period of common garden acclimatization. We found differential expression maintained between the two depths even after common garden acclimatization, and we analysed the polymorphism pattern of these samples. We highlighted contigs potentially implicated in the response to thermal stress, which could be good candidates for the study of thermal adaptation for the red coral. Some of these genes are also involved in the response to thermal stress in other corals. Our method enables the identification of candidate loci of local adaptation useful for other nonmodel organisms.

J	Gutierrez-Rodriguez, C; Lasker, HR				Gutierrez-Rodriguez, C; Lasker, HR			Microsatellite variation reveals high levels of genetic variability and population structure in the gorgonian coral Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae across the Bahamas	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						conservation; gene flow; gorgonian coral; microsatellites; population genetics; Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae	SOFT CORAL; EXUMA SOUND; SEA-LEVEL; FLOW; DIFFERENTIATION; BARRIER; INVERTEBRATE; DISPERSAL; EVOLUTION; SOLITARY	The primary mechanism of gene flow in marine sessile invertebrates is larval dispersal. In Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae, a commercially important Caribbean gorgonian coral, a proportion of the larvae drop to the substratum within close proximity to the maternal colony, and most matings occur between individuals in close proximity to each other. Such limited dispersal of reproductive propagules suggests that gene flow is limited in this gorgonian. In this study, we characterized the population genetic structure of P. elisabethae across the Bahamas using six microsatellite loci. P. elisabethae was collected from 18 sites across the Bahamas. Significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium due to deficits of heterozygotes within populations were detected for all 18 populations in at least one of the six screened loci. Levels of genetic structure among populations of P. elisabethae were high and significant. A distance analysis placed populations within three groups, one formed by populations located within Exuma Sound, a semi-isolated basin, another consisting of populations located outside the basin and a third group comprising two populations from San Salvador Island. The patterns of genetic variation found in this study are concordant with the life-history traits of the species and in part with the geography of the Bahamas. Conservation and management plans developed for P. elisabethae should considered the high degree of genetic structure observed among populations of the species, as well as the high genetic diversity found in the San Salvador and the Exuma Sound populations.

Genetic isolation by distance (IBD) has been used to estimate dispersal in coral reef fishes, but its application in marine systems has been limited by insufficient sampling at different spatial scales and a lack of information regarding population density. Here, we present an analysis of IBD in the barred hamlet (Hypoplectrus puella, Serranidae) at spatial scales ranging from 10 to 3200 km complemented with SCUBA surveys of population densities covering 94 000 m(2) of reef. We used 10 hypervariable DNA markers to genotype 854 fish from 15 locations, and our results establish that IBD in H. puella emerges at a spatial scale of 175 km and is preserved up to the regional scale (3200 km). Assuming a normal or a Laplace dispersal function, our data are consistent with mean dispersal distances in H. puella that range between 2 and 14 km. Such small mean dispersal distances is a surprising result given the three-week pelagic larval duration of H. puella and the low level of genetic structure at the Caribbean scale (Wright's fixation index, F(ST), estimate = 0.005). Our data reinforce the importance of considering population density when estimating dispersal from IBD and underscore the relevance of sampling at local scales, even when genetic structure is weak at the regional scale.

Although the broadscale diversity and phylogenetics of the Symbiodinium complex is well established, there have been surprisingly few data on fine-scale population structure and biogeography of these dinoflagellates. Yet population-level processes contribute strongly to the biology of Symbiodinium, including how anthropogenic-driven global climate change impacts these symbionts and their host associations. Here, we present a synthesis of population-level characteristics for Symbiodinium, with an emphasis on how phylogenetic affinities, dynamics within and among host individuals, and a propensity towards clonality shape patterns on and across reefs. Major inferences include the following: (i) Symbiodinium populations within individual hosts are comprised mainly of cells belonging to a single or few genetic clones. (ii) Symbiont populations exhibit a mixed mode of reproduction, wherein at least one sexual recombination event occurs in the genealogy between most genotypes, but clonal propagation predominates overall. (iii) Mutualistic Symbiodinium do not perpetually persist outside their hosts, instead undergoing turnover and replacement via the continuous shedding of viable clonal cells from host individuals. (iv) Symbiont populations living in the same host, but on different reefs, are often genetically subdivided, suggesting low connectivity, adaptation to local conditions, or prolific asexual reproduction and low effective population sizes leading to disproportionate success within and among hosts. Overall, this synthesis forms a basis for future investigations of coral symbiosis ecology and evolution as well as delimitation of species boundaries in Symbiodinium and other eukaryotic microorganisms.

Based on the long pelagic larval duration (PLD) of the species, long-distance dispersal resulting in high connectivity among populations is hypothesized. LocationEast Africa (Kenya and Tanzania; 2.5 degrees S similar to 10 degrees S) MethodsA total of 269 samples were collected from 11 sample sites in Kenya and Tanzania spanning a distance of 900km. The coral fragments were genotyped using seven microsatellite markers. Analyses included population genetic estimations of diversity and population differentiation, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), Bayesian clustering approaches and testing for isolation by distance (IBD). ResultsModerate, but significant, genetic structure was found when comparing all sample sites, but IBD could not be detected. Based on Bayesian cluster analyses three groups of samples sites could be identified: (1) Kenya and northern Tanzania, (2) southern Tanzania and (3) sample sites located in the Zanzibar and Pemba channels. Main conclusionsHigh connectivity can be explained by the long-distance dispersal capacity of A.tenuis and by the influence of the northbound East African Coastal Current facilitating dispersal by effectively spreading larvae along the coast. Oceanographic characteristics rather than distance are factors that determine connectivity among populations of A.tenuis in Kenya and Tanzania. No clear genetic break was identified. However, variable connectivity between sample sites does occur, with limited connectivity of the sample sites Misali and Stonetown.

Nevertheless, the importance of these marginal populations as putative reservoirs of adaptive genetic variation has scarcely been considered in conservation biology. This is particularly true in marine ecosystems for which the deep refugia hypothesis proposes that disturbed shallow and marginal populations of a given species can be replenished by mesophotic ones. This hypothesis therefore assumes that identical PEIs exist between populations, neglecting the potential for adaptation at species range margins. Here, we combine reciprocal transplant and common garden experiments with population genetics analyses to decipher the PEIs in the red coral, Corallium rubrum. Our analyses reveal partially contrasting PEIs between shallow and mesophotic populations separated by approximately one hundred meters, suggesting that red coral populations may potentially be locally adapted to their environment. Based on the effective population size and connectivity analyses, we posit that genetic drift may be more important than gene flow in the adaptation of the red coral. We further investigate how adaptive divergence could impact population viability in the context of warming and demonstrate differential phenotypic buffering capacities against thermal stress. Our study questions the relevance of the deep refugia hypothesis and highlights the conservation value of marginal populations as a putative reservoir of adaptive genetic polymorphism.

Bayesian clustering methods over all sampling locations revealed evidence of two genetically distinct clusters, one located predominantly on the shallow Sunda Shelf and the second in the deep waters associated with the biogeographic region known as Wallacea; further analysis revealed additional genetic structure around the island of Halmahera and the Islands of Nias and Mentawai. We propose that the observed genetic differentiation is the result of habitat loss during periods of glacial maxima and differences in physical oceanographic properties throughout the Archipelago. The subsequent recolonization of this habitat as glaciers retreat and sea levels return to present-day levels creates an unparalleled opportunity for colonists to exploit new habitat. The documentation of cryptic diversity will aid in the identification of hot spots of biodiversity and ultimately its conservation. These data indicate that genetic structure can be detected in a species that has a relatively high dispersal potential, and this differentiation is a potential source of evolutionary novelty.

Here, we elucidate the population genetic structure of Symbiodinium harboured by the Caribbean octocoral Gorgonia ventalina throughout the entire range of the host. We used ten microsatellite loci to survey 35 localities spanning 3124 km across the Caribbean and Western Atlantic. Diversity of Symbiodinium haplotypes was low within colonies of G. ventalina but high among colonies. Despite high haplotypic diversity, significant evidence of clonal reproduction in Symbiodinium was detected, and most clones occurred within localities, not among them. Pairwise measures of F-ST illustrated significant differentiation in 98% of comparisons between localities, suggesting low levels of gene flow. Clustering analyses identified six genetic groups whose distribution delimited four broad biogeographic regions. There was evidence of some connectivity among regions, corresponding with known geographic and oceanographic features. Fine-scale spatial surveys of G. ventalina colonies failed to detect differentiation among Symbiodinium at the metre scale. However, significant differentiation was observed among Symbiodinium hosted by sympatric G. ventalina colonies of different size/age classes. This cohort effect suggests that Symbiodinium may have an epidemic population structure, whereby G. ventalina recruits are infected by the locally predominant symbiont strain(s), which change over time.

In this context, recent improvements in the study of spatial genetic structure (SGS) are particularly promising because they allow accurate insights into the demographic and evolutionary processes at stake. Using an exhaustive sampling and a combination of image processing and population genetics, we highlighted significant SGS between colonies of Corallium rubrum over an area of half a square metre, which sheds light on a number of aspects of its population biology. Based on this SGS, we found the mean dispersal range within sites to be between 22.6 and 32.1 cm, suggesting that the surveyed area approximately corresponded to a breeding unit. We then conducted a kinship analysis, which revealed a complex half-sib family structure and allowed us to quantify the level of self-recruitment and to characterize aspects of the mating system of this species. Furthermore, significant temporal variations in allele frequencies were observed, suggesting low genetic drift. These results have important conservation implications for the red coral and further our understanding of the microevolutionary processes acting within populations of sessile marine species with a larval phase.

The interconnectivity of these reefs should determine the choice of biological management units, which for most biota will reflect the dispersal of their eggs and/or larvae. A comparative approach using population genetics was used to ask whether the along-shore dispersal of coral reef fishes is influenced by the duration of this mobile phase. Seven species of coral reef fish, selected from three families to provide a range of taxonomic diversity and pelagic larval durations, were tested for genetic homogeneity between two regions of the GBR separated by 1000 km. A spectrum of potential dispersal capabilities was analyzed from that of Acanthochromis polyacanthus, a damselfish with brood care that uniquely lacks pelagic larvae, to that of Ctenochaetus striatus, a surgeonfish with large, specialized larvae that spend several months in the plankton. A total of 19 enzyme systems and general proteins were examined from multiple populations in each region to provide a base of 32 loci for these comparisons. With one exception, species sampled from different coral reefs within regions showed statistically significant heterogeneities across multiple loci, indicative of chaotic genetic patchiness among the samples. The exception was an anemonefish, Amphiprion melanopus, that had to be collected from large areas on each reef because of its law densities. The homogeneity of allele frequencies at local scales for this species suggests that the genetic patchiness observed in others may be a within-reef phenomenon that was manifested at the reef scale by our pseudoreplicated sampling strategy. After pooling local variability, all but two species showed significant regional differences. The exceptions were the pair (Ctenochaetus striatus, Pterocaesio chrysozona) with the longest larval durations. Acanthochromis polyacanthus showed increased variation at this larger scale, consistent with a major stock division between the two regions. The logarithm of genetic Variation between northern and southern populations (measured by Weir and Cockerham's F-st) was correlated with mean larval duration by an inverse linear relationship that explained 85% of the variance in the global data set. Comparison with an outgroup (Amphiprion melanopus from the Chesterfield Reefs, 1000 km east in the Coral Sea) confirmed the genetic cohesion of mainland populations for the species with shortest larval duration and shows that our empirical relationship applies only within the context of the highly connected GBR. On this basis, calculations of gene flow (N(e)m, the number of effective migrants per generation) between geographic regions predict panmixis for species with larval durations exceeding I mo. Many common species have shorter dispersal times, from which classical ''isolation-by-distance'' models predict differentiation between northern and southern populations at genetic equilibrium. Given that modern populations on the GBR are <10 000 yr old, however, there has not been sufficient time for such differences to evolve in situ and we consider alternative scenarios for the observed heterogeneities. Comparisons with invertebrate taxa sampled over the same spatial scales imply lower gene flows in fish despite longer pelagic durations. This suggests that fish larvae may use their greater mobility to retard, rather than enhance, dispersal due to hydrodynamic advection.

The Small Giant Clam, Tridacna maxima Exhibits Minimal Population Genetic Structure in the Red Sea and Genetic Differentiation From the Gulf of Aden	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						tridacnine; conservation; oceanographic barriers; population genetics; species distribution	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; PHYLOGEOGRAPHICAL PATTERNS; NUCLEOTIDE SUBSTITUTIONS; CORAL; CONNECTIVITY; DISPERSAL; OCEAN; TRANSPORT; CARDIIDAE; TRANSITION	The Red Sea serves as a natural laboratory to investigate mechanisms of genetic differentiation and population dynamics of reef organisms due to its high species endemism. Giant clams, important yet understudied coral reef engineering species, are ideal candidates for such study in this region. This paper presents the first population genetics study of giant clams covering the entire East coast of the Red Sea. Our study aimed to investigate the population structure of the small giant clam, Tridacna maxima, based on 501-bp fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase I gene from 194 individuals (126 new sequences from this study plus 68 sequences from GenBank), collected from 14 locations in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden (RSGA). For the genetic analysis, each sampling site was treated as a population. T. maxima showed high genetic diversity, with high gene flow in almost all sampling sites. The insignificant global #ST-value of 0.02 (p > 0.05) suggests the presence of one large, panmictic population across a wide range of temperature and salinity gradients in the RSGA. Despite this, the population in Djibouti was genetically differentiated from the other 11 populations in the Red Sea, suggesting a connectivity break between the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. These results could be explained by the oceanographic features facilitating wide larval transport inside the Red Sea, and creating a dispersal barrier to the Gulf of Aden. Besides larval dispersal by currents, apparent successful establishment following dispersal is probably facilitated by the mode and time of reproduction as well as the ability of T. maxima to achieve high fitness in the highly variable environmental conditions of the Red Sea.

Females of H. japonicus Esaki, 1924 were collected from three distinct aggregations in a single bay (24 degrees 27'5 '' N, 124 degrees 8'40 '' E) on 1-5 November 2006. Two aggregations were formed in respective tide pools of the coral reef and one was formed in the mangrove beds. Amplified fragment length polymorphism markers were used to detect the persistency of each aggregation at a mesoscale. The results suggested that H. japonicus repeatedly immigrated from outside the bay to establish a meta-population of several deme groups. Aggregations along the coastline had some persistency to the line itself and had little tendency to cross to the opposite shore, even when the distance was short.

Among the 3856 clones screened by the partial library method, 10 possibly positive signals were found, and 3 of them could be used to design primers and amplified consistently. In contrast, only one locus isolated by the enrichment method gave reliable amplification and was useful. The results indicate that mierosatellites are rare in Junceella juncea, as reported for other cnidarians. Overall, we obtained 4 polymorphic loci to test the feasibility in investigating clonal structure of [ juncea. A total of 40 multilocus genotypes were found among 152 colonies, and the number of genotypes (clones) identified at 7 reefs ranged from 2 to 16. The results of a nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis indicated the recruitment of J. juncea populations mainly comes from self-retention. These novel microsatellite loci will provide a useful tool to study clonal structure and population genetics for J. juncea in the future.

As a consequence, there is limited information about many aspects of their biology, including genetic diversity. Microsatellite markers have been used to study genetic variability in nonmodel species, such as snakes. The aim of this work was to develop primers for microsatellite regions of the genome of Micrurus surinamensis, to test transferability potential to Micrurus lemniscatus and Micrurus paraensis, and to analyze the genetic diversity of those species. DNA of one specimen of M. surinamensis was sequenced on the MiSeq platform, and sequences were searched for microsatellite regions with 10 primers designed for regions having tetranucleotide motifs. Micrurus surinamensis (n = 12 individuals) presented from 5 to 13 alleles and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.741 to 0.939. Eight markers were successfully transferred to M. lemniscatus (n = 38) and five to M. paraensis (n = 13). The probability of exclusion of paternity ranged from 0.997 to 0.999 for species, and the probability of combined identity was lower in M. surinamensis (8.41 x 10(-9)). These are the first microsatellite markers to be used for studies of coral snake population genetics and conservation.

Absence of genetic differentiation in the coral Pocillopora verrucosa along environmental gradients of the Saudi Arabian Red Sea	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						coral reef; Red Sea; Pocillopora verrucosa; population genetics; connectivity; biogeography	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; EFFECTIVE POPULATION-SIZE; MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA; WHITE PLAGUE DISEASE; SCLERACTINIAN CORAL; SERIATOPORA-HYSTRIX; REPRODUCTIVE MODE; DIVERSITY; DISPERSAL; SOFTWARE	The Red Sea is the world's northernmost tropical sea. The 2000 km long, but narrow basin creates distinct environmental conditions along its latitudinal spread. The Red Sea displays a pronounced salinity gradient from 41 to 37 PSU (north to south) with an opposing temperature gradient from 21 to 27 degrees C in the north to 27-33.8 degrees C in the south. The Red Sea further displays a decreasing nutrient gradient from south to north that can also influence underwater light fields due to higher phytoplankton content and turbidity. Despite this strong variation in temperature, salinity, nutrients, and light conditions, the Red Sea supports large and diverse coral reef ecosystems along its nearly entire coastline. Only few studies have targeted whether these prevailing gradients affect genetic connectivity of reef organisms in the Red Sea. In this study, we sampled the abundant reef-building coral Pocillopora verrucosa from 10 reefs along a latitudinal gradient in the Red Sea covering an area of more than 850 km. We used nine Pocillopora microsatellite markers to assess the underlying population genetic structure and effective population size. To assure the exclusion of cryptic species, all analyzed specimens were chosen from a single mitochondrial lineage. Despite large distances between sampled regions covering pronounced, but smooth temperature and salinity gradients, no significant genetic population structure was found. Rather, our data indicate panmixia and considerable gene flow among regions. The absence of population subdivision driven by environmental factors and over large geographic distances suggests efficient larval dispersal and successful settlement of recruits from a wide range of reef sites. It also advocates, broadcast spawning as the main reproductive strategy of Pocillopora verrucosa in the Red Sea as reflected by the absence of clones in sampled colonies. These factors might explain the success of Pocillopora species throughout the Indo-Pacific and Arabian Seas.

Here, we use a genetic seascape approach and ecological niche modeling to unravel the environmental factors correlating with the genetic variation of Porites panamensis, a hermatypic coral endemic to the ETP. Specifically, we test if levels of diversity and connectivity are higher among abundant than among depauperate populations, as expected by a geographically relaxed version of the Abundant Center Hypothesis (rel-ACH). Unlike the original ACH, referring to a geographical center of distribution of maximal abundance, the rel-ACH refers only to a center of maximum abundance, irrespective of its geographic position. The patterns of relative abundance of P. panamensis in the Mexican Pacific revealed that northern populations from Baja California represent its center of abundance; and southern depauperate populations along the continental margin are peripheral relative to it. Genetic patterns of diversity and structure of nuclear DNA sequences (ribosomal DNA and a single copy open reading frame) and five alloenzymatic loci partially agreed with rel-ACH predictions. We found higher diversity levels in peninsular populations and significant differentiation between peninsular and continental colonies. In addition, continental populations showed higher levels of differentiation and lower connectivity than peninsular populations in the absence of isolation by distance in each region. Some discrepancies with model expectations may relate to the influence of significant habitat discontinuities in the face of limited dispersal potential. Environmental data analyses and niche modeling allowed us to identify temperature, water clarity, and substrate availability as the main factors correlating with patterns of abundance, genetic diversity, and structure, which may hold the key to the survival of P. panamensis in the face of widespread environmental degradation.

The aim of this study was to examine the genetic relationships between multiple colour morphs of Pseudochromis fuscus (family Pseudochromidae), both within and among geographic locations. Pseudochromis fuscus is currently described as a single species, but exhibits at least six discrete colour morphs throughout its range. In this study, P. fuscus from Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, formed three genetically distinct clades based on mitochondrial DNA (control region) sequence data: (1) yellow and brown morphs from the GBR and southern PNG, as well as an orange morph from southern PNG; (2) a pink morph from southern PNG; and (3) all three morphs (pink, orange and grey) found in Kimbe Bay, northern PNG. The three groups showed deep levels of divergence (d=14.6-25.4%), suggesting that P. fuscus is a complex of polychromatic species, rather than a single widespread species with many different colour morphs. Population genetic analyses indicate that the three clades have experienced unique evolutionary histories, possibly from differential effects of sea level fluctuations, barriers to gene flow and historical biogeography.

The haplotype network of N. stumpffi showed a genetic structuration between the two oceans, with shared haplotypes. Concerning N. canalis, western Pacific and central Pacific populations are genetically structured, without shared haplotypes. The Coral Triangle appears to have played a filtering barrier role for N. stumpffi, whose presence in both oceans could be explained by the flow of the south-equatorial current. A barrier to the dispersal of N. canalis between the western and the central Pacific may also exist.

Their abundance reflects both inadequate study of morphological features of living organisms (''pseudo-sibling species'') and divergence in habitat, life history, and chemical recognition systems without parallel divergence in morphology. Many marine sibling species are quite distinct genetically. Others, however, exhibit slight genetic differences whose significance is only clear in sympatry and in combination with other subtle but concordant patterns of differentiation. A large number of abundant, well-studied, or economically important taxa have recently been shown to be complexes of sibling species. The broad habitat and geographic distributions characteristic of many marine species require reevaluation in this context.

However, the effects of fine-scale genetic variation within symbiont populations on host performance are not well understood. Applying quantitative PCR (qPCR) to Pocillopora damicornis colonies from Lord Howe Island (Australia), we estimated the relative abundance of intra-genomically variable (IGV) Symbiodinium cells and those with homogeneous rDNA sequence repeats. We then analysed their physical status and photosynthetic performance at both ambient and extreme summer temperatures (25 and 29 degrees C, respectively) in a closed-system oxygen flux chamber. The proportion of IGV Symbiodinium was negatively correlated with photosynthetic production and efficiency, and under thermal stress, colonies dominated by IGV cells could only meet respiratory demands at high irradiance (> 250 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)). IGV Symbiodinium were also estimated to be 50% larger by volume, occurred at lower density, and had higher chlorophyll c(2)/a ratios. The comparatively poor performance of heterogeneous Symbiodinium cells suggests either a direct deleterious effect of IGV or reduced performance in putative inter-lineage recombinants, whose genomes feature ITS2 variants from both parental ribotypes. While it remains unclear whether the mixed rDNA arrays result from somatic mutation or recombination, our results demonstrate that the beneficial capacity of symbionts can vary within Symbiodinium populations, with potential implications for host fitness.

J	Miller, KJ				Miller, KJ			Genetic structure of black coral populations in New Zealand's fiords	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						antipatharian corals; gene flow; population genetics; asexual reproduction; larval dispersal	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; QUATERNARY EVOLUTION; LOCAL-POPULATIONS; SOUTHERN FIORDS; SEA-ANEMONE; FLOW; CONSEQUENCES; DISPERSAL; EQUILIBRIUM; STARFISH	The antipatharian black coral Antipathes fiordensis is endemic to south-western New Zealand, where most of the population biomass occurs in shallow water throughout a network of fiords and inlets. The planulae larvae of A. fiordensis are negatively buoyant, weak swimming and short lived. These factors, coupled with hydrographic observations of restricted water movement in the fiords, suggest that larval dispersal and gene flow will be Limited in this species, and that separate fiords may represent genetically isolated populations. This study tests the hypothesis of limited larval dispersal in A. fiordensis by examining the genetic variation and population subdivision both within and among fiords. Allozyme electrophoresis at 10 polymorphic loci revealed an unusual population genetic structure in A. fiordensis. Significant genetic variation was found among sites (mean F-ST = 0.046, p < 0.01), suggesting larval dispersal is restricted even at distances of 10 to 15 km. Interestingly, most genetic differentiation occurred between sites within fiords (F-ST = 0.034), rather than among fiords (F-ST = 0.02) which is contrary to the pattern expected if the fiord populations were reproductively isolated. Furthermore, regression of gene flow with geographic distance showed no evidence of isolation-by-distance between populations (r(2) = 0.017), as might be expected in a species with limited larval dispersal. Asexual reproduction was apparent in populations of A. fiordensis, as evidenced by genotypic diversity ratios <1, as well as significant departures from random mating associated with a combination of heterozygote deficits and excesses at the majority of sites. I propose that the atypical genetic structure observed for A. fiordensis in Fiordland represents a population that has not yet reached equilibrium due to a combination of the effects of recent colonisation, asexual reproduction and the potential longevity of individual coral genotypes.

The application of genomics to inform conservation of a functionally important reef fish (Scarus niger) in the Philippines	CONSERVATION GENETICS			English	Article						Parrotfish; Population genetics; Restriction site associated DNA sequencing; Single nucleotide polymorphism; Larval connectivity; Marine protected areas	EFFECTIVE POPULATION-SIZE; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; PAIRWISE RELATEDNESS; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; LOCAL RETENTION; LARVAL EXPORT; R-PACKAGE; CONNECTIVITY; DISPERSAL	Coral reefs within the Coral Triangle (CT) are home to the greatest marine diversity on the globe and are an important supplier of marine resources to densely populated coastal regions. Many coral reefs within the CT and around the world are under threat from over-exploitation. Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been proven to be effective tools in restoring fish stocks. However, the role that MPAs play in promoting connectivity at greater distances through larval dispersal is still unknown. RADseq was used to discover 4253 SNPs from 81 individuals of the dusky parrotfish (Scarus niger) collected from three sites within the Philippines. A lack of population structure suggested a high rate of gene flow (F (ST) = 0.007). Estimates of N-e from linkage disequilibrium are relatively large, ranging from 1200 to 2000. A sibling analysis revealed one pair of well-supported full siblings (r = 0.773) and one pair of putative half siblings (r = 0.191) between sites separated by more than 500 km. The low F (ST) values indicate a high degree of gene flow between the reefs within the sampling area while the sibling analysis suggests demographic connectivity between the Sibuyan Sea and the Sulu Sea. The Mindoro-Panay throughflow is a likely vector by which larvae are transported between these sites, suggesting that reefs in Romblon are sources for reefs near Basay, 400 km to the south. Given the reliance of a vast majority of coral reef fishes on larval dispersal, this study reveals that MPAs established within the central Philippines can supply varying levels of larvae to overfished reefs.

We examined patterns of genetic diversity in populations of two coral reef-dwelling mantis shrimp, Haptosquilla pulchella and Haptosquilla glyptocercus (Stomatopoda: Protosquillidae), on the islands of Anak Krakatau and Rakata, Genetic surveys of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase c (subunit 1) in these populations revealed remarkably high levels of haplotypic and nucleotide diversity that were comparable with undisturbed populations. p throughout the Indo-Pacific. Recolonization and rapid recovery of genetic diversity in the Krakatau populations indicates that larval dispersal from multiple and diverse source populations contributes substantially to the demographics of local populations over intermediate temporal (tens to hundreds of years) and spatial scales (tens to hundreds of kilometres). Natural experiments such as Krakatau provide an excellent mechanism to investigate marine larval dispersal and connectivity. Results from stomatopods indicate that marine reserves should be spaced no more than 50-100 km apart to facilitate ecological connectivity via larval dispersal.

In this area of 'peak' biodiversity, the origins of this high species diversity have often been debated. Xestospongia testudinaria is one of the sponge species that dominates coral reef sponge communities in this region. The role of the so-called 'giant barrel sponge' for the reef ecosystem has been studied repeatedly, as have its various bioactive compounds. However, the genetic variation of this iconic sponge in the region remains unknown. We investigate over 200 barrel sponge samples from Indonesia, and neighbouring as well as more distant localities (Saudi Arabia, Tanzania, Thailand, Taiwan, Java, Sulawesi and the Great Barrier Reef, Australia) using the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1. We compare our results with those from the studies on the congeneric barrel sponges Xestospongia muta from the Caribbean, and Xestospongia bergquistia from the Indo-Pacific, and observe a high degree of overlapping haplotypes between the three barrel sponge species, likely indicating the presence of ancestral polymorphisms. We discuss the implications of these findings to better interpret the phylogeography of barrel sponge taxa in the Indo-Pacific.

Twelve novel microsatellite markers were developed for Xestospongia testudinaria from 454 sequence data and scored across 47 individual barrel sponges collected from the Sampela reef in the Wakatobi Marine National Park, Indonesia. All loci except one was polymorphic with the number of alleles per locus ranging from 5 to 24. Observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.08 to 0.77 and F (IS) values ranged from -1.61 to 0.77, with the majority of loci being in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). We then tested our markers on 28 likely Xestospongia bergquistia specimens from the same reef. Observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.23 to 0.593 and F (IS) values ranged from -0.078 to 0.373; all but two loci were in HWE. Furthermore, we confirmed the differentiation of these two species by Principle Coordinate Analysis and Analysis of Molecular Variance. These markers will be useful for a range of future fine-scale population genetics studies for these two important reef species.

On the spatial scale of dispersal in coral reef fishes	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						isolation by distance; larval dispersal; marine; Mesoamerican Barrier Reef; population genetics; spatial genetics	EFFECTIVE POPULATION-SIZE; REGION-WIDE DECLINES; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; LARVAL DISPERSAL; DEMOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS; BUTTERFLYFISHES PISCES; RECRUITMENT PATTERNS; NEIGHBORHOOD SIZE; CONNECTIVITY	Marine biologists have gone through a paradigm shift, from the assumption that marine populations are largely open owing to extensive larval dispersal to the realization that marine dispersal is more restricted than previously thought. Yet, population genetic studies often reveal low levels of genetic structure across large geographic areas. On the other side, more direct approaches such as mark-recapture provide evidence of localized dispersal. To what extent can direct and indirect studies of marine dispersal be reconciled? One approach consists in applying genetic methods that have been validated with direct estimates of dispersal. Here, we use such an approachgenetic isolation by distance between individuals in continuous populationsto estimate the spatial scale of dispersal in five species of coral reef fish presenting low levels of genetic structure across the Caribbean. Individuals were sampled continuously along a 220-km transect following the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, population densities were estimated from surveys covering 17 200 m(2) of reef, and samples were genotyped at a total of 58 microsatellite loci. A small but positive isolation-by-distance slope was observed in the five species, providing mean parent-offspring dispersal estimates ranging between 7 and 42 km (CI 1113 km) and suggesting that there might be a correlation between minimum/maximum pelagic larval duration and dispersal in coral reef fishes. Coalescent-based simulations indicate that these results are robust to a variety of dispersal distributions and sampling designs. We conclude that low levels of genetic structure across large geographic areas are not necessarily indicative of extensive dispersal at ecological timescales.

Population genetic studies can provide insight on the degree to which populations are connected, and the development of restriction site-associated sequencing (RAD-Seq) methods has made such studies of nonmodel organisms more accessible. We applied double-digest RAD-Seq methods to test for population differentiation in the coral reef-dwelling cardinalfish, Siphamia tubifer, which based on behavioural studies, have the potential to use navigational cues to return to natal reefs. Analysis of 11,836 SNPs from fish collected at coral reefs in Okinawa, Japan, from eleven locations over 3 years reveals little genetic differentiation between groups of S. tubifer at spatial scales from 2 to 140 km and between years at one location: pairwise F-ST values were between 0.0116 and 0.0214. These results suggest that the Kuroshio Current largely influences larval dispersal in the region, and in contrast to expectations based on studies of other cardinalfishes, there is no evidence of population structure for S. tubifer at the spatial scales examined. However, analyses of outlier loci putatively under selection reveal patterns of temporal differentiation that indicate high population turnover and variable larval supply from divergent source populations between years. These findings highlight the need for more studies of fishes across various geographic regions that also examine temporal patterns of genetic differentiation to better understand the potential connections between early life-history traits and connectivity of reef fish populations.

J	Puebla, O; Bermingham, E; Guichard, F				Puebla, Oscar; Bermingham, Eldredge; Guichard, Frederic			Population genetic analyses of Hypoplectrus coral reef fishes provide evidence that local processes are operating during the early stages of marine adaptive radiations	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						coral reef fishes; distribution and abundance; hamlets; marine evolutionary radiations; population genetics; speciation	HAMLETS HYPOPLECTRUS; DIFFERENTIATION; SPECIATION; DISPERSAL; DIVERSITY; INFERENCE	Large-scale, spatially explicit models of adaptive radiation suggest that the spatial genetic structure within a species sampled early in the evolutionary history of an adaptive radiation might be higher than the genetic differentiation between different species formed during the same radiation over all locations. Here we test this hypothesis with a spatial population genetic analysis of Hypoplectrus coral reef fishes (Serranidae), one of the few potential cases of a recent adaptive radiation documented in the marine realm. Microsatellite analyses of Hypoplectrus puella (barred hamlet) and Hypoplectrus nigricans (black hamlet) from Belize, Panama and Barbados validate the population genetic predictions at the regional scale for H. nigricans despite the potential for high levels of gene flow between populations resulting from the 3-week planktonic larval phase of Hypoplectrus. The results are different for H. puella, which is characterized by significantly lower levels of spatial genetic structure than H. nigricans. An extensive field survey of Hypoplectrus population densities complemented by individual-based simulations shows that the higher abundance and more continuous distribution of H. puella could account for the reduced spatial genetic structure within this species. The genetic and demographic data are also consistent with the hypothesis that H. puella might represent the ancestral form of the Hypoplectrus radiation, and that H. nigricans might have evolved repeatedly from H. puella through ecological speciation. Altogether, spatial genetic analysis within and between Hypoplectrus species indicate that local processes can operate at a regional scale within recent marine adaptive radiations.

Here, we present the first assessment of contemporary connectivity among populations of two Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) of the brooding coral Pocillopora damicornis. We used individual-based genetic assignment methods to identify the proportions of philopatric and migrant larval recruits, settling over 12months at sites around Lizard Island (northern Great Barrier Reef [GBR]) and over 24months at sites around the Palms Islands (central GBR). Overall, we found spatially and temporally variable rates of self-recruitment and dispersal, demonstrating the importance of variation in local physical characteristics in driving dispersal processes. Recruitment patterns and inferred dispersal distances differed between the two P.damicornis MOTUs, with type recruits exhibiting predominantly philopatric recruitment, while the majority of type recruits were either migrants from identified putative source populations or assumed migrants based on genetic exclusion from all known populations. While P.damicornis invests much energy into brooding clonal larvae, we found that only 15% and 7% of type and type recruits, respectively, were clones of sampled adult colonies or other recruits, challenging the hypothesis that reproduction is predominantly asexual in this species on the GBR. We explain high rates of self-recruitment and low rates of clonality in these MOTUs by suggesting that locally retained larvae originate predominantly from spawned gametes, while brooded larvae are mainly vagabonds.

A growing body of evidence suggests that marine populations can be structured over short distances despite theoretically high dispersal potential. Yet the proposed mechanisms governing this structure vary, and existing empirical population genetic evidence is of insufficient taxonomic and geographic scope to allow for strong general inferences. Here, we describe the range-wide population genetic structure of an ecologically important Caribbean octocoral, Gorgonia ventalina. Genetic differentiation was positively correlated with geographic distance and negatively correlated with oceanographically modelled dispersal probability throughout the range. Although we observed admixture across hundreds of kilometres, estimated dispersal was low, and populations were differentiated across distances <2 km. These results suggest that populations of G. ventalina may be evolutionarily coupled via gene flow but are largely demographically independent. Observed patterns of differentiation corroborate biogeographic breaks found in other taxa (e.g. an east/west divide near Puerto Rico), and also identify population divides not discussed in previous studies (e.g. the Yucatan Channel). High genotypic diversity and absence of clonemates indicate that sex is the primary reproductive mode for G. ventalina. A comparative analysis of the population structure of G. ventalina and its dinoflagellate symbiont, Symbiodinium, indicates that the dispersal of these symbiotic partners is not coupled, and symbiont transmission occurs horizontally.

The crown-of-thorns starfish Acanthaster planci, recently shown to be a species complex of at least four closely related species, is a coral predator infamous for its outbreaks that have devastated reefs throughout much of its Indo-Pacific distribution. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this first Indian Ocean-wide genetic study of a marine organism we investigated the genetic structure and inferred the paleohistory of the two Indian Ocean sister-species of Acanthaster planci using mitochondrial DNA sequence analyses. We suggest that the first of two main diversification events led to the formation of a Southern and Northern Indian Ocean sister-species in the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene. The second led to the formation of two internal clades within each species around the onset of the last interglacial. The subsequent demographic history of the two lineages strongly differed, the Southern Indian Ocean sister-species showing a signature of recent population expansion and hardly any regional structure, whereas the Northern Indian Ocean sister-species apparently maintained a constant size with highly differentiated regional groupings that were asymmetrically connected by gene flow. Conclusions/Significance: Past and present surface circulation patterns in conjunction with ocean primary productivity were identified as the processes most likely to have shaped the genetic structure between and within the two Indian Ocean lineages. This knowledge will help to understand the biological or ecological differences of the two sibling species and therefore aid in developing strategies to manage population outbreaks of this coral predator in the Indian Ocean.

With a focus on the isolated coral reef ecosystem of the Hawaiian Archipelago, we assessed how life history traits influence population genetic structure for 35 reef animals. Despite the archipelago's stepping stone configuration, isolation by distance was the least common type of genetic structure, detected in four species. Regional structuring (i.e. division of sites into genetically and spatially distinct regions) was most common, detected in 20 species and nearly in all endemics and habitat specialists. Seven species displayed chaotic (spatially unordered) structuring, and all were nonendemic generalist species. Chaotic structure also associated with relatively high global FST. Pelagic larval duration (PLD) was not a strong predictor of variation in population structure (R2=0.22), but accounting for higher FST values of chaotic and invertebrate species, compared to regionally structured and fish species, doubled the power of PLD to explain variation in global FST (adjusted R2=0.50). Multivariate correlation of eight species traits to six genetic traits highlighted dispersal ability, taxonomy (i.e. fish vs. invertebrate) and habitat specialization as strongest influences on genetics, but otherwise left much variation in genetic traits unexplained. Considering that the study design controlled for many sampling and geographical factors, the extreme interspecific variation in spatial genetic patterns observed for Hawaii marine species may be generated by demographic variability due to species-specific abundance and migration patterns and/or seascape and historical factors.

Strong genetic differentiation demarks populations of Favia across biogeographic regions of the Atlantic Ocean	CORAL REEFS			English	Article						Ascension Island; Sao Tome Island; Cryptic species; Population genetics	ASCENSION ISLAND; SPECIES BOUNDARIES; DISPERSAL BARRIERS; TROPICAL ATLANTIC; LARVAL DISPERSAL; MATING SYSTEMS; CORAL; SPECIATION; PATTERNS; EVOLUTION	Understanding how populations are inter-connected can help identify species that are vulnerable or those that are likely to persist over ecological and evolutionary time scales. Favia fragum and Favia gravida are sister species of brooding corals common in the Atlantic Ocean that are secondary reef-builders that contribute to habitat complexity in intertidal and shallow-water coral reefs. To better understand population connectivity in these two congeneric species with broad and presumably non-overlapping distributions, one single-copy nuclear marker (masc1) and one ribosomal marker (ITS) were used to estimate population genetic parameters for Favia in four biogeographic regions: the Caribbean, Brazilian, Ascension and Tropical Eastern Atlantic provinces. Strong and significant levels of population structure were found among all four biogeographic regions, with each province being characterized by nearly all private alleles. Phylogenetic analyses based on each gene and on a combined marker analysis showed strong support for three sister clades composed of individuals from either the Caribbean, South Atlantic (Brazilian + Tropical Eastern Atlantic), or Ascension provinces. However, low genetic diversity was observed at each location, and no differentiation was observed among populations along the entire coast of Brazil (similar to 1600 km). Furthermore, the Tropical Eastern Atlantic was likely colonized by at least two independent founder events, one from the Caribbean and another from the Brazilian provinces. Life-history traits of the genus might explain the different patterns found. Favia fragum and F. gravida release zooxanthellae larvae monthly and may be capable of rafting, which could favor occasional long-distance dispersal. On the other hand, they are capable of self-fertilization and commonly disperse over a few meters which may explain low genetic variability locally. Our results show that while long-distance migration events are possible for Favia corals, they are insufficient to maintain connectivity across biogeographic regions. Lastly, the Ascension Island population was more divergent than the sister clades composed of Caribbean or South Atlantic Favia, indicating a possible cryptic lineage, but further work may clarify species boundaries within the Atlantic coral genus Favia.

Population structure is not a simple function of reproductive mode and larval type: insights from tropical corals	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						microsatellite DNA; population genetics; sexual and asexual reproduction; spatial autocorrelation; larval dispersal	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; RESTRICTED GENE FLOW; ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION; BROODING CORAL; POCILLOPORA-DAMICORNIS; GENOTYPIC DIVERSITY; SERIATOPORA-HYSTRIX; SPECIES BOUNDARIES; SELF-FERTILIZATION; DISTANCE DISPERSAL	1. For a wide range of organisms, heritable variation in life-history characteristics has been shown to be strongly subject to selection, reflecting the impact that variation in characters such as genotypic diversity, duration of larval development and adaptations for dispersal can have on the fitness of offspring and the make-up of populations. Indeed, variation in life-history characteristics, especially reproduction and larval type, have often been used to predict patterns of dispersal and resultant population structures in marine invertebrates. 2. Scleractinian corals are excellent models with which to test this relationship, as they exhibit almost every possible combination of reproductive mode and larval type. Some general patterns are emerging but, contrary to expectations, genetic data suggest that while populations of broadcast spawning species may be genotypically diverse they may be heavily reliant on localized recruitment rather than widespread dispersal of larvae. 3. Here we use microsatellites to test the importance of localized recruitment by comparing the genetic structure of populations of two broadcast spawning corals with contrasting modes of reproduction and larval development; Goniastrea favulus is self-compatible, has sticky, negatively buoyant eggs and larvae and is expected to have restricted dispersal of gametes and larvae. In contrast, Platygyra daedalea is self-incompatibile, spawns positively buoyant egg-sperm bundles and has planktonic development. 4. Surprisingly, spatial-autocorrelation revealed no fine-scale clustering of similar genotypes within sites for G. favulus, but showed a non-random distribution of genotypes in P. daedalea. Both species showed similar levels of genetic subdivision among sites separated by 50-100 m (F-ST = 0.03), suggesting that larval dispersal may be equivalent in both species. 5. Interestingly, as fragmentation has been considered rare in massive corals, our sample of 284 P. daedalea colonies included 28 replicated genotypes that were each unlikely (P < 0.05) to have been derived independently from sexual reproduction. 6. We conclude that the extreme life history of G. favulus does not produce unusually fine-scale genetic structure and subsequently, that reproductive mode and larval type may not be not good predictors of population structure or dispersal ability.

J	Drew, JA; Barber, PH				Drew, Joshua A.; Barber, Paul H.			Comparative Phylogeography in Fijian Coral Reef Fishes: A Multi-Taxa Approach towards Marine Reserve Design	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GENETIC-STRUCTURE; POPULATION-GENETICS; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; PELAGIC LARVAE; CONSERVATION; UMBRELLA; POMACENTRIDAE; CONNECTIVITY; MIGRATION; ENDEMISM	Delineating barriers to connectivity is important in marine reserve design as they describe the strength and number of connections among a reserve's constituent parts, and ultimately help characterize the resilience of the system to perturbations at each node. Here we demonstrate the utility of multi-taxa phylogeography in the design of a system of marine protected areas within Fiji. Gathering mtDNA control region data from five species of coral reef fish in five genera and two families, we find a range of population structure patterns, from those experiencing little (Chrysiptera talboti, Halichoeres hortulanus, and Pomacentrus maafu), to moderate (Amphiprion barberi, Phi(st) = 0.14 and Amblyglyphidodon orbicularis Phi(st) = 0.05) barriers to dispersal. Furthermore estimates of gene flow over ecological time scales suggest species-specific, asymmetric migration among the regions within Fiji. The diversity among species-specific results underscores the limitations of generalizing from single-taxon studies, including the inability to differentiate between a species-specific result and a replication of concordant phylogeographic patterns, and suggests that greater taxonomic coverage results in greater resolution of community dynamics within Fiji. Our results indicate that the Fijian reefs should not be managed as a single unit, and that closely related species can express dramatically different levels of population connectivity.

This expectation was tested for two closely related coral reef fish, the tube blennies Acanthemblemaria aspera and A. spinosa. These two have similar life histories and dispersal potentials, and co-occur throughout the Caribbean. Sequence data for one mitochondrial and two nuclear markers were collected for 168 individuals across the species' Caribbean ranges. Although both species shared a similar pattern of genetic subdivision, A. spinosa had 20-25 times greater nucleotide sequence divergence among populations than A. aspera at all three markers. Substitution rates estimated using a relaxed clock approach revealed that mitochondrial COI is evolving at 11.2% pairwise sequence divergence per million years. This rapid mitochondrial rate had obscured the signal of old population expansions for both species, which were only recovered using the more slowly evolving nuclear markers. However, the rapid COI rate allowed the recovery of a recent expansion in A. aspera corresponding to a period of increased habitat availability. Only by combining both nuclear and mitochondrial data were we able to recover the complex demographic history of these fish.

Regional and local environmental conditions do not shape the response to warming of a marine habitat-forming species	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CORAL CORALLIUM-RUBRUM; MEDITERRANEAN RED CORAL; MASS MORTALITY EVENTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; Q(ST)-F-ST COMPARISONS; CONTRASTING PATTERNS; PARAMURICEA-CLAVATA; BENTHIC COMMUNITIES; QUANTITATIVE TRAIT; GENETIC-STRUCTURE	The differential response of marine populations to climate change remains poorly understood. Here, we combine common garden thermotolerance experiments in aquaria and population genetics to disentangle the factors driving the population response to thermal stress in a temperate habitatforming species: the octocoral Paramuricea clavata. Using eight populations separated from tens of meters to hundreds of kilometers, which were differentially impacted by recent mortality events, we identify 25 degrees C as a critical thermal threshold. After one week of exposure at this temperature, seven of the eight populations were affected by tissue necrosis and after 30 days of exposure at this temperature, the mean % of affected colonies increased gradually from 3 to 97%. We then demonstrate the weak relation between the observed differential phenotypic responses and the local temperature regimes experienced by each population. A significant correlation was observed between these responses and the extent of genetic drift impacting each population. Local adaptation may thus be hindered by genetic drift, which seems to be the main driver of the differential response. Accordingly, conservation measures should promote connectivity and control density erosion in order to limit the impact of genetic drift on marine populations facing climate change.

Multiple introductions and secondary dispersion of Tubastraea spp. in the Southwestern Atlantic	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							POPULATION-GENETICS; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; MUSSISMILIA-HISPIDA; PROPAGULE PRESSURE; ASEXUAL PRODUCTION; RANGE EXPANSION; R-PACKAGE; CORAL; COCCINEA; DIVERSITY	Accidental introduction through ballast water and biofouling are currently the main factors responsible for spreading non-indigenous species in the marine realm. In the Southwestern Atlantic, two scleractinian corals, Tubastraea coccinea and T. tagusensis, have been introduced by opportunistic colonization in 1980 and are now widespread along more than 3,500 km of coastline. To better understand the invasion process and the role of vectors in spreading these species, we sampled 306 and 173 colonies of T. coccinea and T. tagusensis from invaded sites, possible vectors and one native population. Analyses revealed a higher diversity of multi-locus genotypes (MLGs) on vectors, suggesting that they were contaminated prior to their arrival in the Southwestern Atlantic, and a high proportion of clones at invaded sites, with few genotypes spread over similar to 2,000 km. This broad distribution is most likely a result of secondary introductions through the transport of contaminated vectors. Results also suggest the occurrence of multiple invasions, mainly in the northernmost sites. In summary, clonality, secondary introductions, and multiple invasions are the main reasons for the broad spread and invasive success of Tubastraea spp. in the Southwestern Atlantic. Consequently, the correct control of vectors is the most effective approach for management and prevention of new invasions.	[Capel, K. C.

Zoological Studies 49(5): 657-668. Acropora is the most speciose genus of scleractinian corals. However, phylogenies among closely related species and population genetics of Acropora remain equivocal. In this study, 7 AAT-repeat loci developed from the Caribbean species, A. palamta, and 5 dinucleotide (CT/GT)-repeat microsatellites newly developed from the lndo-West-Pacific (IWP) species, A. muricata, were examined to determine their utility for revealing the mutation rate and genetic diversity of Acropora species. Five of the 8 AAT-repeat loci were successfully amplified in IWP species, with DNA sequences in the flanking region showing over 97% similarity to those of the Caribbean species, suggesting homology of these AAT loci among these cross-oceanic Acropora. In contrast, amplifications of all GT-repeat loci failed in the Caribbean species. Eight loci (5 AAT and 3 CT/GT ones) showed Mendelian inheritance based on crossing experiments of A. muricata larvae. When the mutation rate (0) was estimated, AAT-repeat loci showed relatively higher mutation rates (0 = 39.94-112.82) compared to GT-repeat loci (0 = 2.44-53.33). Analysis of molecular variance indicated a relatively higher within-population variation at AAT-repeat loci (98.6%) than at GT-repeat loci (78.7%). The F-ST statistic of 2 sympatric Acropora species (A. muricata and A. digitifera) indicated that the value for AAT loci (F-ST = 0.014) was about 15 times lower than that for GT loci (F-ST = 0.213), although both microsatellite motifs showed statistically significant differentiation of species. Our study highlights that AAT-repeat loci might have functional constraints and result in underestimating the genetic variability of species and populations; thus, their application to revealing genetic variations within Acropora should be utilized with caution. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/49.5/657.pdf	[Tang, Pei-Ciao; Wei, Nuwei Vivian; Chen, Chein-Wei; Chen, Chaolun Allen] Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Tang, Pei-Ciao] Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Dept Biol, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA; [Wallace, Carden C.] Museum Trop Queensland, Townsville, Qld Q4810, Australia; [Chen, Chein-Wei; Chen, Chaolun Allen] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Chen, Chaolun Allen] Natl Taitung Univ, Inst Life Sci, Taitung 950, Taiwan		Chen, CA (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 115, Taiwan.	cac@gate.sinica.edu.tw			Academia Sinica Thematic	Academia Sinica Thematic(Academia Sinica - Taiwan)	Many thanks go to Y.Y.

Contrasting clonal structure among Pocillopora (Scleractinia) communities at two environmentally distinct sites in the Gulf of California	CORAL REEFS			English	Article						Clonal reproduction; Eastern Tropical Pacific; Microsatellites; Pocillopora; Population structure	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION; SEXUAL REPRODUCTION; GENUS POCILLOPORA; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; GENOTYPIC DIVERSITY; POPULATION-GENETICS; EASTERN PACIFIC; CORAL	The contributions of sexual versus asexual reproduction are thought to play an important role in the abundance and ecological success of corals, especially in marginal habitats. Pocillopora corals are distributed throughout the Indo-Pacific and dominate shallow hard-bottom communities in the eastern Pacific where broad seasonal fluctuations in temperature and water turbidity create suboptimal conditions for reef community development. Previous work had revealed three genetic clades in the eastern Pacific that show little correspondence with colony morphology; the broad distribution of type 1 extends into the subtropical southern Gulf of California. Here we examine genetic and clonal structure of two type 1 communities separated by 10 km with microsatellite data. Samples were collected randomly in six 10 m radius circular plots (20 colonies per plot, 3 plots per site). Sites differed in their relative clonality because clonemates (ramets) from a single clone (genet) dominated a large portion (90.9 m long) of the protected leeward side of Gaviota Island (Number of genets/Number of samples = 0.35; observed Genotypic diversity/expected Genotypic diversity = 0.087), while an exposed community at the entrance to La Paz Bay, Punta Galeras, exhibited high genotypic diversity (N (g) /N = 0.85; G (o) /G (e) = 0.714). Gene flow was unrestricted between sites indicating these communities comprised a single population. The relative proportion of asexual colonies found between community aggregations of Pocillopora in the Gulf of California differed significantly and suggests factors at local, not regional, scales affect these patterns. The possibility that heterogeneity in clonal structure is common throughout the eastern Pacific and across the west Indo-Pacific requires further study. Finally, since morphological variation in Pocillopora has been underappreciated and is in need of taxonomic revision, the use of a consistent field-sampling protocol and high-resolution makers will advance ecological research and aid in the conservation of these corals.

Beside effective enforcement, an accurate understanding of the eco-evolutionary processes underlying the patterns of biodiversity is needed to reap the benefits of management policies. In this context, integrating population genetics with demographic data, the demo-genetic approach, is particularly relevant to shift from a "species-based pattern" toward an "eco-evolutionarybased processes" conservation. Here, targeting a key species in the Mediterranean coralligenous, the red coral, Corallium rubrum, in an emblematic Mediterranean MPA, the "Reserve Naturelle de Scandola" (France), we applied demo-genetic approaches at two contrasted spatial scales, among populations and within one population, to (i) infer the demographic connectivity among populations in the metapopulation network and (ii) shed new light on the genetic connectivity and on the demographic transitions underlying the dynamics of a near-pristine population. Integrating different spatial and temporal scales, we demonstrated (i) an apparent temporal stability in the pattern of genetic diversity and structure in the MPA in spite of a dramatic demographic decline and (ii) contrasted levels of genetic isolation but substantial demographic connectivity among populations. Focusing on the near-pristine population, we complemented the characterization of red coral demographic connectivity suggesting (iii) temporal variability and (iv) the occurrence of collective dispersal. In addition, we demonstrated (v) contrasted patterns of spatial genetic structure (SGS), depending on the considered stage-class (adults vs. juveniles), in the near-pristine population. This last result points out that the overall SGS resulted from a restricted dispersal of locally produced juveniles (SGS among adults and juveniles) combined to mortality during early life stages (decrease of SGS from juveniles to adults). Demonstrating the occurrence of two management units and the importance of two populations (CAVB and ALE) for the network of connectivity, we made recommendations for the management of the Reserve Naturelle de Scandola. Besides, we contributed to the implementation of scientifically driven restoration protocols in red coral by providing estimates for the size, density, and distances among patches of transplanted colonies. <comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment	[Gazulla, Carlota R.; Lopez-Sendino, Paula; Garrabou, Joaquim; Ledoux, Jean-Baptiste] CSIC, Inst Ciencias Mar, Barcelona, Spain; [Gazulla, Carlota R.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Genet & Microbiol, Barcelona, Spain; [Antunes, Agostinho; Ledoux, Jean-Baptiste] Univ Porto, Ctr Interdisciplinar Invest Marinha & Ambiental, CIIMAR, CIMAR, Porto, Portugal; [Antunes, Agostinho] Univ Porto, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Porto, Portugal; [Aurelle, Didier; Garrabou, Joaquim] Univ Toulon & Var, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IRD,MIO, Marseille, France; [Aurelle, Didier] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Museum Natl Hist Nat, EPHE,Inst Systemat,Evolut,Biodivers, Paris, France; [Montero-Serra, Ignasi; Linares, Cristina] Univ Barcelona, Inst Recerca Biodiversitat, Dept Biol Evolutiva Ecol & Ciencies Ambientals, Barcelona, Spain; [Dominici, Jean-Marie] Reserve Nat Scandola, Parc Reg Corse, Galeria, France		Garrabou, J; Ledoux, JB (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Ciencias Mar, Barcelona, Spain.; Ledoux, JB (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Ctr Interdisciplinar Invest Marinha & Ambiental, CIIMAR, CIMAR, Porto, Portugal.; Garrabou, J (corresponding author), Univ Toulon & Var, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IRD,MIO, Marseille, France.	garrabou@icm.csic.es; jbaptiste.ledoux@gmail.com	Linares, Cristina/A-5244-2018	Linares, Cristina/0000-0003-3855-2743; Aurelle, Didier/0000-0002-3922-7291	FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology [UIDB/04423/2020, UIDP/04423/2020]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); Spanish MINECO [CGL201232194]; TOTAL Foundation PERFECT project; MIMOSA project - foundation Prince Albert II de Monaco; European Union [689518]; Interdisciplinary Centre of Marine and Environmental Research - European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through COMPETE2020 - Operational Program for Competitiveness and Internationalization (POCI) [UID/Multi/04423/2019]; FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC); Conseil Regional d'Aquitaine [20030304002FA, 20040305003FA]; European Union FEDER [2003227]; Investissements d'Avenir [ANR10EQPX1601]; "Severo Ochoa Centre of Excellence" accreditation [CEX2019000928S]; CSIC Open Access Publication Support Initiative through its Unit of Information Resources for Research (URICI)	FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Commission); Spanish MINECO(Spanish Government); TOTAL Foundation PERFECT project; MIMOSA project - foundation Prince Albert II de Monaco; European Union(European Commission); Interdisciplinary Centre of Marine and Environmental Research - European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through COMPETE2020 - Operational Program for Competitiveness and Internationalization (POCI); FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC); Conseil Regional d'Aquitaine(Region Nouvelle-Aquitaine); European Union FEDER(European Commission); Investissements d'Avenir(French National Research Agency (ANR)); "Severo Ochoa Centre of Excellence" accreditation; CSIC Open Access Publication Support Initiative through its Unit of Information Resources for Research (URICI)	This research was supported by the Strategic Funding UIDB/04423/2020 and UIDP/04423/2020 through national funds provided by the FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology and European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) , in the framework of the program PT2020, the Spanish MINECO (CGL201232194) , the TOTAL Foundation PERFECT project, the MIMOSA project funded by the foundation Prince Albert II de Monaco, and the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program under grant agreement N? 689518 (MERCES) .

Isolation and characterisation of 18 polymorphic microsatellite loci for black marlin (Istiompax indica) and their utility for Pacific billfish species	FISHERIES RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Billfish Symposium	NOV 04-08, 2013	Taipei, TAIWAN			Billfish; Fisheries management; Population genetics; Next-generation sequencing	SOFTWARE; MARKERS	We present the isolation and characterisation of 18 polymorphic microsatellite loci with perfect 3 and 4-bp repeats for the black marlin Istiompax indica using Ion Torrent next-generation sequencing techniques. Usefulness of these markers for genetic studies was assessed by screening 16 specimens collected throughout the Indo-Pacific basin for this broadly distributed and exploited species. A total of 30 black marlin from the West Coral Sea were genotyped producing between 2 and 20 alleles per locus (mean 5.27) with expected heterozygosity (H-E) ranging from 0.095 to 0.843. The genotypic distribution of all loci conformed to Hardy-Weinberg expectations with no evidence of null alleles. Evaluations of cross-species amplification of these markers on five additional Pacific billfish species indicates the utility of these markers for genetic studies of other Istiophorids.

The three-spot damselfish (Dascyllus trimaculatus) species complex comprises four species that vary both in geographical ranges and colour patterns making them an ideal model to study these relationships. We analysed the mitochondrial control region of 122 individuals from all four species collected from 13 localities. Individuals from two species (Dascyllus albisella and D. strasburgi) grouped into monophyletic clades, while the two other species (D. trimaculatus and D. auripinnis) were found to be paraphyletic. Coloration patterns were therefore not found to be good predictors of genetic isolation. In contrast, geographical origin was always consistent with the observed genetic pattern.

However, here we show for the first time intraorganism genetic heterogeneity in natural populations of marine sponges. A total of 36 different multilocus genotypes (MLGs) were detected in 13 individuals of Scopalina lophyropoda sampled at 4 distant points within each sponge. All genotypes (showing a mosaic distribution), were transmitted to the progeny, thus contributing to the high genetic diversity and low clonality reported for this species, although its populations are small and structured and show high fission rates. There did not seem to be intraindividual genotype conflicts; on the contrary, chimeric individuals are expected to show low mortality thanks to the differential mortality of their different MLGs. This novel mechanism may also counterbalance genetic constraints in other benthic invertebrate species. The presence of sponge chimerism also suggests that results from previous population genetics studies could have been misinterpreted.

In marine systems, determining the scale, rate, and directionality of larval dispersal is therefore, central to understanding how coral metapopulations are interconnected and the degree of resiliency in the event of a localized disturbance. Understanding these source-sink dynamics is essential to guide restoration efforts and for the study of ecology and evolution in the ocean. The patterns and mechanisms of connectivity in the deep-sea (>200 m deep) are largely understudied. In this study, we investigated the spatial diversity patterns and metapopulation connectivity of the octocoral Paramuricea biscaya throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Paramuricea biscaya is one of the most abundant corals on the lower continental slope (between 1,200 and 2,500 m) in the GoM. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill (DWH) directly impacted populations of this species and thus are considered primary targets for restoration. We used a combination of seascape genomic analyses, high-resolution ocean circulation modeling, and larval dispersal simulations to quantify the degree of population structuring and connectivity among P. biscaya populations. Evidence supports the hypotheses that the genetic diversity of P. biscaya is structured by depth, and that larval dispersal among connected populations is asymmetric due to dominant ocean circulation patterns. Our results suggest that there are intermediate unsampled populations in the central GoM that serve as stepping stones for dispersal. The data suggest that the DeSoto Canyon area, and possibly the West Florida Escarpment, critically act as sources of larvae for areas impacted by the DWH oil spill in the Mississippi Canyon. This work illustrates that the management of deep-sea marine protected areas should incorporate knowledge of connectivity networks and depth-dependent processes throughout the water column.

This species is widely distributed, inhabiting coral reefs of the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Our study evaluated population genetic structure and levels of genetic diversity in southern Japan. A total of 180 individuals were collected frorn eight locations from Okinawa and Okinoerabu Islands and sequenced using mitochondria' 16S ribosomal DNA (16S) and nuclear histone H3 (H3) gene. Only three 16S haplotypes were detected (518 bp) with haplotype diversity ranging from 0 to 0.56 and nucleotide diversity from 0 to 0.1%. H3 showed no variation among the studied locations. It is plausible that such results could be due to a shift to asexual reproduction. Additionally, the presence of the species on the east coast of Okinawa could only be detected in one location arid all individuals consisted of a single haplotype. Genetic differences between the east and west coasts of Okinawa have been noticed in other coral reef organisms, and attributed to either ecological or biogeographical historical differences between the coasts due to differing levels of isolation during Pleistocene ice ages. Results from the present study should inform management and conservation policies of S. chloronotus in southern Japan.

Small-scale isolation can be crucial for understanding genetic diversity within a species. The present study examined the population genetic structure of the sand bubbler crab Scopimera ryukyuensis, which is endemic to the Ryukyu Islands in the northwestern Pacific. A total of 52 haplotypes of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I were recovered from 197 specimens collected from four islands. The haplotype and nucleotide diversities were relatively high in the central Ryukyus (Amami-Oshima and Okinawa Islands) with some exceptions but were low at the southern edge of the geographical distribution of the species, i.e., the southern Ryukyus (Ishigaki and Iriomote Islands). Pairwise F-ST analysis suggested that the gene flow of S. ryukyuensis was largely restricted. The local populations of the species are differentiated among islands, except for stations on Ishigaki Island and a station on Iriomote Island. Moreover, a clear intra-island population genetic structure was observed within Amami-Oshima and Iriomote Islands, e.g., only 20 km between stations. Small-scale isolation among local populations may be a common tendency for coastal species in the Ryukyu Islands, considering the results of previous studies on corals.

Extreme seascape drives local recruitment and genetic divergence in brooding and spawning corals in remote north-west Australia	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Acropora aspera; conservation genomics; Isopora brueggemanni; marine reserve networks; population connectivity; single nucleotide polymorphism	SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION ANALYSIS; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; POPULATION-GENETICS; LARVAL DISPERSAL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; R-PACKAGE; INTEGRATING CONNECTIVITY; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; SPECIES BOUNDARIES; NINGALOO REEF	Management strategies designed to conserve coral reefs threatened by climate change need to incorporate knowledge of the spatial distribution of inter- and intra-specific genetic diversity. We characterized patterns of genetic diversity and connectivity using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two reef-building corals to explore the eco-evolutionary processes that sustain populations in north-west Australia. Our sampling focused on the unique reefs of the Kimberley; we collected the broadcast spawning coralAcropora aspera(n = 534) and the brooding coralIsopora brueggemanni(n = 612) across inter-archipelago (tens to hundreds of kilometres), inter-reef (kilometres to tens of kilometres) and within-reef (tens of metres to a few kilometres) scales. Initial analysis ofA. asperaidentified four highly divergent lineages that were co-occurring but morphologically similar. Subsequent population analyses focused on the most abundant and widespread lineage,Acroporaasp-c. Although the overall level of geographic subdivision was greater in the brooder than in the spawner, fundamental similarities in patterns of genetic structure were evident. Most notably, limits to gene flow were observed at scales <35 kilometres. Further, we observed four discrete clusters and a semi-permeable barrier to dispersal that were geographically consistent between species. Finally, sites experiencing bigger tides were more connected to the metapopulation and had greater gene diversity than those experiencing smaller tides. Our data indicate that the inshore reefs of the Kimberley are genetically isolated from neighbouring oceanic bioregions, but occasional dispersal between inshore archipelagos is important for the redistribution of evolutionarily important genetic diversity. Additionally, these results suggest that networks of marine reserves that effectively protect reefs from local pressures should be spaced within a few tens of kilometres to conserve the existing patterns of demographic and genetic connectivity.

J	Titus, BM; Daly, M				Titus, Benjamin M.; Daly, Marymegan			Specialist and generalist symbionts show counterintuitive levels of genetic diversity and discordant demographic histories along the Florida Reef Tract	CORAL REEFS			English	Article						Approximate Bayesian computation; Comparative phylogeography; Crustaceans; Sea anemones; Symbiosis; Coral reefs	SEA FAN CORAL; COMPARATIVE PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; SPECIES DELIMITATION; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; SNAPPING SHRIMPS; SOFTWARE; CARIDEA; ANEMONE; COMPLEX; CONNECTIVITY	Specialist and generalist life histories are expected to result in contrasting levels of genetic diversity at the population level, and symbioses are expected to lead to patterns that reflect a shared biogeographic history and co-diversification. We test these assumptions using mtDNA sequencing and a comparative phylogeographic approach for six co-occurring crustacean species that are symbiotic with sea anemones on western Atlantic coral reefs, yet vary in their host specificities: four are host specialists and two are host generalists. We first conducted species discovery analyses to delimit cryptic lineages, followed by classic population genetic diversity analyses for each delimited taxon, and then reconstructed the demographic history for each taxon using traditional summary statistics, Bayesian skyline plots, and approximate Bayesian computation to test for signatures of recent and concerted population expansion. The genetic diversity values recovered here contravene the expectations of the specialist-generalist variation hypothesis and classic population genetics theory; all specialist lineages had greater genetic diversity than generalists. Demography suggests recent population expansions in all taxa, although Bayesian skyline plots and approximate Bayesian computation suggest the timing and magnitude of these events were idiosyncratic. These results do not meet the a priori expectation of concordance among symbiotic taxa and suggest that intrinsic aspects of species biology may contribute more to phylogeographic history than extrinsic forces that shape whole communities. The recovery of two cryptic specialist lineages adds an additional layer of biodiversity to this symbiosis and contributes to an emerging pattern of cryptic speciation in the specialist taxa. Our results underscore the differences in the evolutionary processes acting on marine systems from the terrestrial processes that often drive theory. Finally, we continue to highlight the Florida Reef Tract as an important biodiversity hotspot.

J	Duffy, JE				Duffy, JE			Species boundaries, specialization, and the radiation of sponge-dwelling alpheid shrimp	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						coral reefs; diversity; ecological specialization; sibling species; speciation; symbiosis; Synalpheus	POPULATION-GENETICS; RIBOSOMAL-RNA; UNITED-STATES; HOST; SPECIATION; PATTERNS; SEA; DIFFERENTIATION	Microevolutionary studies and natural history suggest that host-specialization has promoted the high diversity of tropical sponge-dwelling snapping shrimps (Decapoda, Alpheidae, Synalpheus). Yet the taxonomic difficulty of this genus has precluded rigorous tests of this hypothesis. S. rathbunae Coutiere is among the most abundant invertebrates inhabiting the framework of sponges and dead coral that forms the floor of Caribbean coral reefs. Even within a small area S. rathbunae exhibits the apparently wide variation in size, color, and morphology that has long frustrated efforts to identify and define species boundaries within this large (> 100 described species) genus. Here I show that sympatric populations of this nominal species occupying different sponge hosts display clear, concordant differences in allozyme genotypes and in multivariate morphometrics, confirming that the populations represent three distinct biological species. Moreover, careful field sampling revealed that the three S. rathbunae taxa and the closely related S. filidigitus Armstrong showed almost no overlap in the species of hosts occupied. Interestingly, while there was significant differentiation between Belizean and Panamanian populations of the one taxon that occurred at both sites (similar to 1500 km apart), these populations were recognizable as conspecific using both genetic and morphological characters. These results show that (1) diversity of Synalpheus, which is already among the most species-rich crustacean genera, is probably several times higher than currently recognized, and (2) species of sponge-dwelling Synalpheus are highly host-specific, with related species distinctly segregated among hosts. Together with previous evidence of host race differentiation within shrimp species, these results suggest a primary role for resource specialization in the origin and/or maintenance of this group's characteristically high diversity.

In this taxonomic contribution, we describe both sexes of a new copepod species of the family Novocriniidae Huys and Iliffe in Zool Scr 27(1):1-15, 1998 from a mesophotic coral reef off southwestern Puerto Rico. This is only the fifth species of the family and the fourth of the genus Atergopedia Martinez Arbizu and Moura in Zool Beitr NF 38:189-210, 1998. The new species, Atergopedia dowgialli sp. nov., shares the following characters with its three congeners: 1) antenna without seta on the first endopodal segment; 2) lateral armature of the female antenna shows a multiplication of distinct setae and consists of one geniculate seta followed by five or more slender setae; 3) the first endopod segment of the first swimming leg P1 bears no inner seta; 4) male fifth leg with two spines on endopodal lobe; and 5) the exopod of the fifth swimming leg fused to basendopod in the female. Atergopedia dowgialli sp. nov. is characterized by the loss of the basal seta in both antenna and maxilliped, the loss of the first maxilla endite, the presence of a long process between the outer and distal elements of the leg 1 exopodite 3, which is stronger and longer in the female, and the possession of a very short and strongly ornamented furca in both sexes. The genus Atergopedia has been found in deep and relatively shallow habitats from the Arctic Ocean to the Caribbean. In contrast, almost all species of the taxon Novocrinidimorpha, which includes the families Novocriniidae, Superornatiremidae Huys 1996, and Rotundiclipeidae Huys 1988, have been found associated with anchialine caves, indicating a derived distribution for Atergopedia.

However the causes underlying these different patterns are not properly understood. In this paper, we tested the hypotheses that population connectivity is positively related to a combination of life history traits, namely duration of pelagic larval period and the tendency towards pelagic life style in the adulthood. To do so, we analysed the variability of six microsatellite and one mitochondrial marker (cytochrome b) in three Southern Ocean fish species (Trematomus newnesi, Trematomus hansoni and Trematomus bernacchii). They share a recent common ancestor but notably differ in their duration of pelagic larval period as well as pelagic versus benthic lifestyle. We sampled over a range of more than 5000 km for all three species and used a number of population genetics tools to investigate past and contemporary levels of connectivity. All species experienced population fluctuations, but coalescent simulations suggested that contemporary populations are in migration-drift equilibrium. Although global F-ST values were rather low, a significant population structure separated the High-Antarctic from the Peninsular regions in all species. The level of genetic differentiation was much lower in the pelagic versus benthic species. Present data suggest that past and present genetic structuring in the Southern Ocean are indeed related with the ecological traits of Antarctic fish, however the relative importance of individual factors remains unclear.

While most phylogeographic studies testing these hypotheses have focused on marine fishes, we provide a new perspective on this evolutionary important question by examining the population genetics of the horned ghost crab Ocypode ceratophthalmus sensu lato (Ocypodidae) whose distribution spans the entire Indo-Pacific and contains at least two colour morphs. Location Methods Indo-Pacific region, spanning from East Africa, India, East Asia to Central Pacific. Population genetics analyses based on mitochondrial COI and nuclear NaK intron sequences of O. ceratophthalmus from 39 sites throughout the Indo-Pacific. Results Main conclusions We found at least three genetically distinct geographical clades in O. ceratophthalmus, corresponding to the east, west and central region of the species' range. Divergent clades were found to have originated in the peripheral Central Pacific and West Indian Ocean. Populations at the eastern margin of IAA harbour the highest genetic diversity, due to the co-existence of east and central clades in these populations. Peripheral isolation plays an important role in shaping evolutionary history of this species. Particularly, secondary dispersal of divergent lineages from the Central Pacific contributes to the high diversity found in the IAA. Thus, the Centre of Accumulation hypothesis best describes the evolutionary and demographic history of O. ceratophthalmus.	[Ma, Ka Yan; Chow, Lai Him; Ip, Brian H.

Therefore, living fossils are model organisms to study both long-term and ongoing adaptation and speciation processes. However, many aspects of living fossil evolution and their persistence in the modern world remain unclear. Here, we investigate three major aspects of the evolutionary history of living fossils: cryptic speciation, population genetics and effective population sizes, using members of the genera Nautilus and Allonautilus as classic examples of true living fossils. For this, we analysed genome-wide ddRAD-Seq data for all six currently recognized nautiloid species throughout their distribution range. Our analyses identified three major allopatric Nautilus clades: a South Pacific clade, subdivided into three subclades with no signs of admixture between them; a Coral Sea clade, consisting of two genetically distinct populations with significant admixture; and a widespread Indo-Pacific clade, devoid of significant genetic substructure. Within these major clades, we detected five Nautilus groups, which likely correspond to five distinct species. With the exception of Nautilus macromphalus, all previously described species are at odds with genome-wide data, testifying to the prevalence of cryptic species among living fossils. Detailed FST analyses further revealed significant genome-wide and locus-specific signatures of selection between species and differentiated populations, which is demonstrated here for the first time in a living fossil. Finally, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) simulations suggest large effective population sizes, which may explain the low levels of population differentiation commonly observed in living fossils.

Microsatellites Reveal Genetic Homogeneity among Outbreak Populations of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (Acanthaster cf. solaris) on Australia's Great Barrier Reef	DIVERSITY-BASEL			English	Article						coral reefs; Great Barrier Reef Marine Park; population genetics; approximate Bayesian computation	APPROXIMATE BAYESIAN COMPUTATION; DNA-SEQUENCE; R-PACKAGE; PLANCI; SOFTWARE; INFERENCE; GENOTYPE; INVASIONS; RECOVERY; MARKERS	Specific patterns in the initiation and spread of reef-wide outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish are important, both to understand potential causes (or triggers) of outbreaks and to develop more effective and highly targeted management and containment responses. Using analyses of genetic diversity and structure (based on 17 microsatellite loci), this study attempted to resolve the specific origin for recent outbreaks of crown-of-thorns on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR). We assessed the genetic structure amongst 2705 starfish collected from 13 coral reefs in four regions that spanned -1000 km of the GBR. Our results indicate that populations sampled across the full length of the GBR are genetically homogeneous (G'(ST) = -0.001; p = 0.948) with no apparent genetic structure between regions. Approximate Bayesian computational analyses suggest that all sampled populations had a common origin and that current outbreaking populations of crown-of-thorns starfish (CoTS) in the Swains are not independent of outbreak populations in the northern GBR. Despite hierarchical sampling and large numbers of CoTS genotyped from individual reefs and regions, limited genetic structure meant we were unable to determine a putative source population for the current outbreak of CoTS on the GBR. The very high genetic homogeneity of sampled populations and limited evidence of inbreeding indicate rapid expansion in population size from multiple, undifferentiated latent populations.

J	Ayre, DJ; Hughes, TP; Standish, RS				Ayre, DJ; Hughes, TP; Standish, RS			Genetic differentiation, reproductive mode, and gene flow in the brooding coral pocillopora damicornis along the Great Barrier Reef, Australia	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						gene flow; corals; life history; population genetics; recruitment; sex; asexual reproduction	MONTASTRAEA-ANNULARIS ELLIS; ANEMONE ACTINIA-TENEBROSA; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; BUILDING CORAL; ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION; MARINE-INVERTEBRATES; LARVAL DISPERSAL; DAPHNIA-PULEX; SUBDIVISION	The widespread and morphologically var;variable coral Pocillopora damicornis has been reported to exhibit huge variation in Life-history traits (e.g. mode of reproduction, growth rate, longevity and dispersal) both locally and regionally throughout the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Dispersal may be achieved by the settlement of sexually or asexually generated brooded planula larvae, by broadcast spawning or more locally through asexual fragmentation of large colonies. In the present study, we conducted a hierarchical survey of allozyme variation within:hin and among reef-crest sites on 3 mid-shelf reefs separated by up to 1200 km on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. Our objective was to use allozyme data (1) to quantify local and regional patterns of variation in P., damicornis (along the northeastern coast of Australia), (2) to determine the relative contribution of sexual versus asexual production of planulae in P., damicornis, and (3) to estimate levels of gene flow among adjacent sites (>5 km apart) and among reefs separated by 500 to 1200 km. High levels of genotypic diversity in our samples of P. damicornis imply that dispersive propagules in this species are produced sexually rather than asexually along the length of the GBR. Corals at all sites displayed: the same level of multi-locus genotypic diversity expected for randomly mating, sexually derived populations, and the majority of individual colonies possessed unique 7-locus genotypes. We also detected consistent deficits of heterozygotes within each collection (from 3 local sites on each of the 3 widely spaced reefs). This pattern is consistent with the predicted effects of sexual reproduction associated with some localised dispersal of gametes or larvae (although other explanations cannot be excluded). Furthermore, each reef was genetically subdivided, suggesting that larval recruitment was localised and that these populations are slightly inbred: hierarchical analysis of the standardised genetic variances (F-ST) (estimated as Weir & Cockerham's theta) revealed that, although there was only moderate variation among all 9 sites (F-ST = 0.055 +/- 0.029), more variation was found among sites within reefs (F-SL = 0.035 +/- 0.04 to 0.088 +/-: 0.033) than among distant reefs (F-LT = 0.008 +/- 0.014). This homogeneity of gene frequencies across widely separated reefs implies that reefs are connected by high:gh levels of gene flow (N(e)m approximate to 31) and that local populations of P. damicornis separated by >1000 km can interbreed sufficiently to maintain a consistent suite of life-history characters.

Highly contrasted responses of Mediterranean octocorals to climate change along a depth gradient	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE			English	Article						climate change; adaptation; acclimatization; Eunicella cavolini; Mediterranean sea; population genetics	GORGONIAN EUNICELLA-SINGULARIS; CORAL CORALLIUM-RUBRUM; MASS MORTALITY; BENTHIC COMMUNITIES; REEF CORAL; POPULATION; EVOLUTIONARY; ACCLIMATION; ENVIRONMENT; ADAPTATION	Climate change has a strong impact on marine ecosystems, including temperate species. Analysing the diversity of thermotolerance levels within species along with their genetic structure enables a better understanding of their potential response to climate change. We performed this integrative study on the Mediterranean octocoral Eunicella cavolini, with samples from different depths and by means of a common garden experiment. This species does not host photosynthetic Symbiodinium, enabling us to focus on the cnidarian response. We compared the thermotolerance of individuals from 20 m and 40 m depths from the same site and with replicates from the same colony. On the basis of an innovative statistical analysis of necrosis kinetics and risk, we demonstrated the occurrence of a very different response between depths at this local scale, with lower thermotolerance of deep individuals. Strongly thermotolerant individuals were observed at 20 m with necrosis appearing at higher temperatures than observed in situ. On the basis of nine microsatellite loci, we showed that these marked thermotolerance differences occur within a single population. This suggests the importance of acclimatization processes in adaptation to these different depths. In addition, differences between replicates demonstrated the occurrence of a variability of response between fragments from the same colony with the possibility of an interaction with a tank effect. Our results provide a basis for studying adaptation and acclimatization in Mediterranean octocorals in a heterogeneous environment.	[Pivotto, I.

Histological examination of ten reproductive individuals of the Western Australian sponge Haliclona sp. showed that this species broods embryonic larvae that are potentially limited in dispersal capabilities. Because sponges have the potential to propagate in a number of modes, allozyme electrophoresis was used to assess the relative importance of asexual and sexual reproduction to recruitment, and to quantify genetic subdivision over different spatial scales. Tissue samples from 227 sponges were collected from reefs within two areas 400 km apart: Hamelin Bay and Rottnest Island. Contrary to expectations for highly clonal populations, genotypic diversity within sites was high, no linkage disequilibrium was found, and there was no evidence of genotypic clustering within reefs. There was no genetic evidence that asexual reproduction is important for the maintenance of populations. Genetic comparisons were consistent with mixing of sexually produced recruits within reefs, on a scale up to a few hundred metres, but significant genetic subdivision between reefs (F-ST=0.069 at Hamelin Bay, 0.130 at Rottnest Island) indicated that water gaps of several hundred metres are effective at preventing dispersal. Subdivision between the two areas, separated by 400 km, was moderately greater (F-ST=0.142) than within, but the same alleles were predominant in the two areas. These genetic patterns are consistent with limited dispersal capabilities of brooded larvae.

Seascape continuity plays an important role in determining patterns of spatial genetic structure in a coral reef fish	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						connectivity; ecology; gene flow; marine; metapopulation; spatial genetic structure	HOUTMAN-ABROLHOS ISLANDS; POPULATION-GENETICS; OCEAN CURRENTS; DISPERSAL; DIFFERENTIATION; HABITAT; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; CONNECTIVITY; SUBDIVISION; PROGRAM	Detecting patterns of spatial genetic structure (SGS) can help identify intrinsic and extrinsic barriers to gene flow within metapopulations. For marine organisms such as coral reef fishes, identifying these barriers is critical to predicting evolutionary dynamics and demarcating evolutionarily significant units for conservation. In this study, we adopted an alternative hypothesis-testing framework to identify the patterns and predictors of SGS in the Caribbean reef fish Elacatinus lori. First, genetic structure was estimated using nuclear microsatellites and mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences. Next, clustering and network analyses were applied to visualize patterns of SGS. Finally, logistic regressions and linear mixed models were used to identify the predictors of SGS. Both sets of markers revealed low global structure: mitochondrial phi ST=0.12, microsatellite FST=0.0056. However, there was high variability among pairwise estimates, ranging from no differentiation between sites on contiguous reef (phi ST=0) to strong differentiation between sites separated by ocean expanses20km (maximum phi ST=0.65). Genetic clustering and statistical analyses provided additional support for the hypothesis that seascape discontinuity, represented by oceanic breaks between patches of reef habitat, is a key predictor of SGS in E. lori. Notably, the estimated patterns and predictors of SGS were consistent between both sets of markers. Combined with previous studies of dispersal in E.lori, these results suggest that the interaction between seascape continuity and the dispersal kernel plays an important role in determining genetic connectivity within metapopulations.

We sequenced two mitochondrial regions (cytochrome b and control region) and genotyped 12 microsatellite loci in a total of 296 individuals collected from 14 reefs in two biogeographic provinces in the tropical western Atlantic Ocean and from three provinces within the Caribbean Sea. We used phylogeography, population genetics and coalescent methods to assess the potential effects of climatic oscillations in the Pleistocene and contemporary oceanographic barriers on the population genetic structure and connectivity of the species. Sequence analyses indicated high genetic diversity and a lack of genetic differentiation throughout the Caribbean and between the two biogeographic provinces. Different lines of evidence depicted demographic expansions of A. saxatilis populations dated to the Pleistocene. The microsatellites exhibited high genetic diversity, and no genetic differentiation was detected within the Caribbean; however, these markers identified a genetic discontinuity between the two western Atlantic biogeographic provinces. Migration estimates revealed gene flow across the Amazon Orinoco Plume, suggesting that genetic divergence may be promoted by differential environmental conditions on either side of the barrier. The climatic oscillations of the Pleistocene, together with oceanographic barriers and the dispersal potential of the species, constitute important factors determining the geographic patterns of genetic variation in A. saxatilis.

Despite their importance as deep-water habitats, the underlying genetic structure and gene-flow patterns of most deep-water populations remain largely unknown. Here, we evaluated genetic connectivity of the primnoid octocoral Narella versluysi across the continental shelf of Bay of Biscay, spanning 360 km (95 samples from submarine canyons, ranging from 709-1247 m depths). We report 12 novel microsatellite markers which were used to genotype 83 samples from 6 populations. Sixteen samples were sequenced for three mitochondrial DNA regions (Folmer region of COI with an adjacent intergenic region igr1, MT-ND2 gene, and mtMutS homolog 1 region). All sequence haplotypes and genetic clusters were found in multiple sites spanning more than 200 km. Overall, our analyses suggest that there is high gene flow between colonies of N. versluysi among all study sites. There is no significant geographic structure and no pattern of isolation by distance or depth. Connectivity is facilitated by the prevailing current which runs along the shelf break, and could be a mechanism to connect all of the sampled locations. The high connectivity over large geographic distance is a positive sign for a potentially vulnerable organism and may provide some resilience to disturbance. This information is crucial for a better understanding of how this fragile benthic fauna may respond to climatic and anthropogenic disturbances, which is a cornerstone for effective habitat management.

Although the ecology of the banded butterflyfish has been well studied over its entire range, nothing is known about its phylogeography and how biogeographic barriers structure its populations. To assess the level of genetic connectivity among populations from distinct biogeographic provinces and environmental conditions, we collected samples from seven localities: Puerto Rico, in the Caribbean, and Tamandare, Salvador, Abrolhos, Trindade Island, Arraial do Cabo and Florianopolis, in Brazil. One nuclear (rag 2) and two mitochondrial (control region and cyt b) molecular markers were sequenced. Our findings are consistent with a recent population expansion, around 30-120 thousand years ago, which was found for all populations. Haplotype network analyses point to the Caribbean as a refugium before the population expansion. Results show no geographic pattern of genetic diversity. Indeed, a lack of population structure was found and no isolation was observed across oceanographic barriers, as well as between coral and rocky reef ecosystems. Furthermore, no directionality in the migration pattern was found among populations. Since ecological and environmental characteristics are very diverse across such a vast geographic range, the lack of genetic differentiation suggests that C. striatus evolved ecological plasticity rather than local adaptation in the western Atlantic.

Geographical and ecological distributions reveal distinctly asymmetrical global patterns of flatfish species diversity. The greatest diversity is found in marine waters of the Indo-West Pacific; other tropical seas support fewer species (diversity decreases progressively from western Atlantic, tropical Eastern Pacific, to Eastern Atlantic, respectively). Fewer species inhabit temperate waters, while the least diverse flatfish assemblages are in northern and southern polar waters and at isolated islands. Ecologically, flatfishes range from estuaries to the outer continental shelf and upper continental slope to about 2000 m. Notable differences in diversity occur between continental and insular locations. Few species inhabit freshwaters. Maximal species richness within regions occurs on extensive continental shelves featuring complex shallow-water (< 200 m) habitats. Phylogenetic studies of interrelationships and intrarelationships of flatfishes are currently insufficient for analyses of their historical biogeography.

The ophiuroid Astrobrachion constrictum lives on black coral in these fiords, and is thought to have a relatively short pelagic larval duration that may limit dispersal among populations. Samples of A. constrictum were collected from seven sites (four fiords) in Fiordland. Analysis of the mitochondrial COI gene using single-stranded conformational polymorphism revealed eight haplotypes, representatives of which were sequenced. These included nine variable sites, none of which were phylogenetically informative. G-test and AMOVA revealed little structuring of samples within or among fiords, but there was evidence for reduced gene flow among the most geographically separated fiords. We conclude that fiords do not house relict populations from earlier glaciations, and that little differential sorting of haplotypes has occurred in the last 10,000 years.	[Steel, D. J.; Trewick, S.

These include one species each of the deep-sea genera Funiculina, Halipteris, Protoptilum and Distichoptilum, four species each of Umbellula and Pennatula, three species of Kophobelemnon and two species of Anthoptilum, as well as one species of the epi- and mesobenthic genus Virgularia. Seventeen circular genomes ranged from 18,513 bp (Halipteris cf. finmarchica) to 19,171 bp (Distichoptilum gracile) and contained all genes standard to octocoral mitochondrial genomes (14 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes and one transfer RNA). We found at least three different gene orders in Pennatulacea: the ancestral gene order, the gene order found in bamboo corals (Family Isididae), and a novel gene order. The mitogenome of one species of Umbellula has a bipartite genome (similar to 13 kbp and similar to 5 kbp), with good evidence that both parts are circular.	[Hogan, Raissa, I; Allcock, A.

The Ogasawara Islands belong to the most isolated archipelagos on Earth and are well-known for their high terrestrial endemicity; however, less is known about the marine realm. Here, we analyse the degree of oceanographic isolation of the archipelago based on genetic data of a reef-building coral and a biophysical dispersal model. Location North-Western Pacific (Ogasawara, Ryukyu, Daito Islands, Guam). Taxon Galaxea fascicularis L. Method Three to 15 specimens were sampled at several sites in Ogasawara and its closest potential migration sources in southern Japan and the Mariana Islands (Guam) and RAD-sequenced. 108 specimens from the common Pacific lineages 'L' (Ryukyu- and Daito Islands, Guam) and 'Ogasawara' (Ogasawara) were analysed with population genetics and demographic modelling. Oceanographic dispersal was investigated by inverse particle tracking using a Lagrangian particle advection simulation based on ROMS and applying biological dispersal parameters of G. fascicularis. Results The G. fascicularis population in Ogasawara is genetically highly differentiated from the next closest reefs in the region and has diverged from the Ryukyu Islands under very little, asymmetric, eastward migration. Inverse particle tracking confirmed the oceanographic isolation of Ogasawara and showed that the islands are rarely but most likely reached by settlers from the Ryukyu Islands by long-distance-dispersal of exceptionally long-lived larvae (>44 days), with no dispersal vice versa. Main conclusions Ogasawara is a dispersal sink location and the high degree of genetic differentiation in Galaxea has resulted from strong oceanographic isolation. This research highlights how oceanographic features impact species-level genetic differentiation even in well-dispersed taxa such as broadcast-spawning corals, and they are likely even more pronounced in less vagile organisms. These findings suggest the Ogasawaran Archipelago should be considered an important priority for marine conservation, alongside its high importance for terrestrial conservation.

Contrasting abundance and contribution of clonal proliferation to the population structure of the corkscrew sea anemone Bartholomea annulata in the tropical Western Atlantic	INVERTEBRATE BIOLOGY			English	Article						Actiniaria; life history; microsatellite; population genetics; reproduction	ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION; ANTHOPLEURA-ELEGANTISSIMA; CARIBBEAN CORAL; INTRASPECIFIC AGGRESSION; CLEANING INTERACTIONS; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; SEXUAL REPRODUCTION; GENETIC DIVERSITY; GORGONIAN CORAL; ACTINIARIA	Clonal propagation is an important life history trait for many sessile organisms, and often leads to the formation of monoclonal aggregations. In the marine environment, sea anemones have been model species for testing theory regarding the evolution of sex and understanding the contribution of sexual versus asexual reproduction to the population structure in facultatively clonal animals. However, little attention has been paid to tropical actiniarians. The corkscrew anemone Bartholomea annulata is common in tropical marine habitats in the western Atlantic and Caribbean; it forms small aggregations (2-4 anemones) on coral reefs and larger aggregations (>10 anemones) in mangrove habitats. We used field surveys and molecular analyses to investigate patterns of distribution, abundance, and genetic structure of aggregations formed by B. annulata on a reef in the US Virgin Islands and in a unique mangrove habitat in the Florida Keys. Abundance was greatest at the abandoned rock quarry mangrove habitat in the Florida Keys, where anemones formed continuously distributed aggregations carpeting the exposed limestone walls. Genetic diversity assessed via intersimple sequence repeats (ISSRs) and six microsatellite loci revealed that asexual reproduction plays only a minor role in the formation of both small and large anemone aggregations. Specifically, ISSR analyses showed that only similar to 10% of anemone aggregations were clonal in the US Virgin Islands, while microsatellite genotyping identified clonality in only 1 of 35 aggregations. In the Florida Keys, only four clonal genotypes were recovered within aggregations, but eight clones, representing 33% of the total surveyed population, had individuals in multiple aggregations. Thus, population structure of B. annulata appears to rely primarily on sexual reproduction, although asexual reproduction may play a nontrivial role in some environments. Mechanisms that drive the formation of genotypically diverse aggregations remain unknown, but may include attraction toward conspecifics, shared use of preferred habitats, or the local retention of larvae in partially enclosed habitats.

Lingering Impacts of Hurricane Hugo on Rhizophora mangle (Red Mangrove) Population Genetics on St. John, USVI	DIVERSITY-BASEL			English	Article						genetic diversity; connectivity; UNESCO Biosphere Reserve; stochastic events	CLIMATE-CHANGE; CORAL-REEF; RESTORATION; FORESTS; GROWTH; DISTURBANCE; DIVERSITY; EXPANSION; KNOWLEDGE; RESPONSES	Stochastic events can have catastrophic effects on island populations through a series of genetic stressors from reduced population size. We investigated five populations of red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) from St. John, USVI, an UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, which were impacted by Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Our goal was to determine diversity and to ascertain potential population bottlenecks two decades after the event. With the lowest observed heterozygosity, highest inbreeding coefficient, and evidence of a major bottleneck, our results demonstrated that the Great Lameshur mangroves, devastated by Hurricane Hugo, were the least diverse stand of trees. The other four populations from St. John manifested diversity reflecting the vegetation patterns of fringing mangrove or developed forest characteristics. The two fringing mangrove populations (Hurricane Hole and New Found Bay) evinced low observed heterozygosity and high inbreeding coefficients, while the fully forested sites showed higher heterozygosity and lower inbreeding frequencies. As such, fringing mangroves may be at greater risk to disturbance events and especially susceptible to sea level rise since they do not have room landward to expand. Our pair-wise population analysis indicated genetic similarity between the hurricane-damaged Great Lameshur and Coral Bay population, whose propagules were used in previous restoration attempts and is the geographically closest population. While the effective population size for Great Lameshur Bay places it in risk of genetic dysfunction, future rehabilitation of the site may be possible by the introduction of propagules from other regions of the island. However, recovery will ultimately be contingent upon hydrological connectivity and environmental improvements.	[Bologna, Paul A.

J	Lasker, HR; Porto-Hannes, I				Lasker, Howard R.; Porto-Hannes, Isabel			Population structure among octocoral adults and recruits identifies scale dependent patterns of population isolation in The Bahamas	PEERJ			English	Article						Microsatellites; Octocorallia; Population genetics; Isolation by distance; Pseudopterogorgia; Gorgonian	CORAL-REEF FISH; SPATIAL GENETIC-STRUCTURE; MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA; LARVAL DISPERSAL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PSEUDOPTEROGORGIA-ELISABETHAE; SEASCAPE GENETICS; GORGONIAN CORAL; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; SERIATOPORA-HYSTRIX	Patterns of dispersal and connectivity of the Caribbean gorgonian Antillogorgia elisabethae in The Bahamas were assessed in both adults and recently settled recruits from 13 sites using microsatellite loci. Adult populations along the Little Bahama Bank (LBB) exhibited a clear pattern of isolation by distance (IBD) which described 86% of the variance in pairwise genetic distances. Estimates of dispersal based on the IBD model suggested dispersal distances along the LBB on the order of 100 m. Increasing the spatial scale to include sites separated by open ocean generated an apparent IBD signal but the relationship had a greater slope and explained less of the variance. This relationship with distance reflected both stepping stone based IBD and regional differentiation probably created by ocean currents and barriers to dispersal that are correlated with geographic distance. Analysis of recruits from 4 sites on the LBB from up to 6 years did not detect differences between years nor differences with adult populations. The result suggests that neither selection on recruits nor inter-annual variation in dispersal affected adult population structure. Assignment tests of recruits indicated the most likely sources of the recruits were the local or adjacent populations. Most of the patterning in population structure in the northern Bahamas can be explained by geographic distance and oceanographic connectivity. Recognition of these complex patterns is important in developing management plans for A. elisabethae and in understanding the effects of disturbance to adult populations of A. elisabethae and similar species with limited dispersal.

Genomic signatures of geographic isolation and natural selection in coral reef fishes	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						adaptation; genetic drift; natural selection; outlier loci; RADSeq; speciation	ECOLOGICAL SPECIATION; COLOR PATTERN; SURGEONFISHES ACANTHURIDAE; HAMLETS HYPOPLECTRUS; POPULATION-GENETICS; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; CICHLID FISH; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; EVOLUTION; PACIFIC	The drivers of speciation remain among the most controversial topics in evolutionary biology. Initially, Darwin emphasized natural selection as a primary mechanism of speciation, but the architects of the modern synthesis largely abandoned that view in favour of divergence by geographic isolation. The balance between selection and isolation is still at the forefront of the evolutionary debate, especially for the world's tropical oceans where biodiversity is high, but isolating barriers are few. Here, we identify the drivers of speciation in Pacific reef fishes of the genus Acanthurus by comparative genome scans of two peripheral populations that split from a large Central-West Pacific lineage at roughly the same time. Mitochondrial sequences indicate that populations in the Hawaiian Archipelago and the Marquesas Islands became isolated approximately 0.5Ma. The Hawaiian lineage is morphologically indistinguishable from the widespread Pacific form, but the Marquesan form is recognized as a distinct species that occupies an unusual tropical ecosystem characterized by upwelling, turbidity, temperature fluctuations, algal blooms and little coral cover. An analysis of 3737 SNPs reveals a strong signal of selection at the Marquesas, with 59 loci under disruptive selection including an opsin Rh2 locus. While both the Hawaiian and Marquesan populations indicate signals of drift, the former shows a weak signal of selection that is comparable with populations in the Central-West Pacific. This contrast between closely related lineages reveals one population diverging due primarily to geographic isolation and genetic drift, and the other achieving taxonomic species status under the influence of selection.

Development and characterization of new polymorphic microsatellite markers in four sea anemones: Entacmaea quadricolor, Heteractis magnifica, Stichodactyla gigantea, and Stichodactyla mertensii	MARINE BIODIVERSITY			English	Article						Cnidarian; Connectivity; Host anemone; Papua New Guinea; Population genetics; Red Sea	POPULATION GENETIC-STRUCTURE; CORAL-REEF FISH; NEMATOSTELLA-VECTENSIS; ACTINIA-TENEBROSA; RED-SEA; SOFTWARE; REPRODUCTION; CNIDARIA; REPLENISHMENT; AMPLIFICATION	Relatively few studies have investigated the genetic population structure of sea anemones. This is particularly true for sea anemones that host some of the most iconic fishes on coral reefs, the anemonefishes. One of the main reasons for this knowledge gap is the lack of appropriate genetic markers. We developed and characterized a total of 47 novel polymorphic microsatellite markers for four host sea anemone species from the Indo-Pacific: Entacmaea quadricolor (n=16 microsatellite markers), Heteractis magnifica (n=8), Stichodactyla mertensii (n=13), and Stichodactyla gigantea (n=10). Here, we report genetic diversity statistics from two different sampling locations for each anemone species. Overall, we found that most markers were highly polymorphic. On average, we found a mean of seven alleles per locus. Observed and expected heterozygosities displayed high variation among loci, ranging from 0.033 to 0.980 and from 0.038 to 0.927, respectively. Only four loci showed deviations of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both populations and were identified as having null alleles. Additionally, two pairs of loci were identified to be in linkage disequilibrium in only one population. Host anemones are highly sought after in the marine aquarium trade and are susceptible to thermal bleaching. Although most studies focus on their obligate symbionts (the anemonefish), genetic analyses of host sea anemones can expand our understanding of the biology, connectivity, and population structure of these organisms and potentially help develop conservation strategies that will aid both the host and its symbionts.

Productivity links morphology, symbiont specificity and bleaching in the evolution of Caribbean octocoral symbioses	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article							GORGONIAN SOFT CORAL; WATER-QUALITY; SEA-ANEMONE; SYMBIODINIUM; DEPTH; CNIDARIA; NITROGEN; CARBON; HOST; HETEROTROPHY	Many cnidarians host endosymbiotic dinoflagellates from the genus Symbiodinium. It is generally assumed that the symbiosis is mutualistic, where the host benefits from symbiont photosynthesis while providing protection and photosynthetic substrates. Diverse assemblages of symbiotic gorgonian octocorals can be found in hard bottom communities throughout the Caribbean. While current research has focused on the phylo- and population genetics of gorgonian symbiont types and their photophysiology, relatively less work has focused on biogeochemical benefits conferred to the host and how these benefits vary across host species. Here we examine this symbiosis among 11 gorgonian species collected in Bocas del Toro, Panama. By coupling light and dark bottle incubations (P/R) with C-13-bicarbonate tracers, we quantified the link between holobiont oxygen metabolism with carbon assimilation and translocation from symbiont to host. Our data show that P/R varied among species, and was correlated with colony morphology and polyp size. Sea fans and sea plumes were net autotrophs (P/R>1.5), while nine species of sea rods were net heterotrophs with most below compensation (P/R<1.0). C-13 assimilation corroborated the P/R results, and maximum delta C-13(host) values were strongly correlated with polyp size, indicating higher productivity by colonies with high polyp SA:V. A survey of gorgonian-Symbiodinium associations revealed that productive species maintain specialized, obligate symbioses and are more resistant to coral bleaching, whereas generalist and facultative associations are common among sea rods that have higher bleaching sensitivities. Overall, productivity and polyp size had strong phylogenetic signals with carbon fixation and polyp size showing evidence of trait covariance.

We developed microsatellite markers for the broadcast spawning gorgonian octocoral Eunicea (Plexaura) flexuosa (four markers) and its dinoflagellate symbiont, Symbiodinium B1 (five markers), and used them to assess genetic connectivity, specificity and directionality of gene flow among sites in Florida, Panama, Saba and the Dominican Republic. Bayesian analyses found that most E. flexuosa from the Florida reef tract, Saba and the Dominican Republic were strongly differentiated from many E. flexuosa in Panama, with the exception of five colonies from Key West that clustered with colonies from Panama. In contrast, Symbiodinium B1 was more highly structured. At least seven populations were detected that showed patterns of isolation by distance. The symbionts in the five unusual Key West colonies also clustered with symbionts from Panama, suggesting these colonies are the result of long-distance dispersal. Migration rate tests indicated a weak signal of northward immigration from the Panama population into the lower Florida Keys. As E. flexuosa clonemates only rarely associated with the same Symbiodinium B1 genotype (and vice versa), these data suggest a dynamic host-symbiont relationship in which E. flexuosa is relatively well dispersed but likely acquires Symbiodinium B1 from highly structured natal areas prior to dispersal. Once vectored by host larvae, these symbionts may then spread through the local population, and/or host colonies may acquire different local symbiont genotypes over time.

Even though rocky shore invertebrates have been used as model systems to understand genetic structure in some marine environments, our understanding of connectivity in Caribbean communities is based overwhelmingly on studies of tropical fishes and corals. In this study, we investigate population connectivity and diversity of Cittarium pica, an abundant rocky shore trochid gastropod that is commercially harvested across its natural range, from the Bahamas to Venezuela. Methodology/Principal Findings: We tested for genetic structure using DNA sequence variation at the mitochondrial COI and 16S loci, AMOVA and distance-based methods. We found substantial differentiation among Caribbean sites. Yet, genetic differentiation was associated only with larger geographic scales within the Caribbean, and the pattern of differentiation only partially matched previous assessments of Caribbean connectivity, including those based on larval dispersal from hydrodynamic models. For instance, the Bahamas, considered an independent region by previous hydrodynamic studies, showed strong association with Eastern Caribbean sites in our study. Further, Bonaire (located in the east and close to the meridional division of the Caribbean basin) seems to be isolated from other Eastern sites. Conclusions/Significance: The significant genetic structure and observed in C. pica has some commonalities in pattern with more commonly sampled taxa, but presents features, such as the differentiation of Bonaire, that appear unique. Further, the level of differentiation, together with regional patterns of diversity, has important implications for the application of conservation and management strategies in this commercially harvested species.

The limited distribution and sensitivity to bottom fishing activities make F.quadrangularis vulnerable to reduction in population numbers that may lead to genetic isolation and reduced diversity. Because of this vulnerability and low resilience to physical disturbance, the tall sea pen is recognised as a Species of Principle Importance under the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act, 2006, UK. () and is also on the Biodiversity Action Plan list of Priority Species for the UK. In the Mediterranean it is recognised as a sensitive and essential fish habitat because it forms habitat for several commercially important crustaceans. The aim of this study was to understand the current state of the genetic structure and gene flow of F.quadrangularis in areas of NW Scotland. We developed 10 microsatellite markers and used them to genotype 176 samples from four populations. Overall, our results suggest that there is high genetic diversity and high gene flow between colonies of F.quadrangularis in and among locations in Loch Linnhe and Loch Duich. As a result of the high rates of gene flow, genetic differentiation between sites was low. This may provide resilience to human impacts if distant populations have a high connectivity. However, care must be taken, as small but significant isolation by distance was found between the most geographically distant sites and only a small part of the species range was examined in this study. The genetic tools developed here will provide a foundation for wider studies of this vulnerable species.

Ross			Genetic consequences of introducing allopatric lineages of Bluestriped Snapper (Lutjanus kasmira) to Hawaii	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						alien species; bottleneck; introductions; invasion biology; mtDNA; Marquesas; nuclear DNA; Papahanaumokuakea; Society Islands	CORAL-REEF FISH; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; POPULATION-GENETICS; PROPAGULE PRESSURE; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; INVASION BIOLOGY; MULTIPLE SOURCES; SPECIES COMPLEX; DIFFERENTIATION; BOTTLENECK	A half century ago the State of Hawaii began a remarkable, if unintentional, experiment on the population genetics of introduced species, by releasing 2431 Bluestriped Snappers (Lutjanus kasmira) from the Marquesas Islands in 1958 and 728 conspecifics from the Society Islands in 1961. By 1992 L. kasmira had spread across the entire archipelago, including locations 2000 km from the release site. Genetic surveys of the source populations reveal diagnostic differences in the mtDNA control region (d = 3.8%; phi(ST) = 0.734, P < 0.001) and significant allele frequency differences at nuclear DNA loci (F-ST = 0.49; P < 0.001). These findings, which indicate that source populations have been isolated for approximately half a million years, set the stage for a survey of the Hawaiian Archipelago (N = 385) to determine the success of these introductions in terms of genetic diversity and breeding behaviour. Both Marquesas and Society mtDNA lineages were detected at each survey site across the Hawaiian Archipelago, at about the same proportion or slightly less than the original 3.4:1 introduction ratio. Nuclear allele frequencies and parentage tests demonstrate that the two source populations are freely interbreeding. The introduction of 2431 Marquesan founders produced only a slight reduction in mtDNA diversity (17%), while the 728 Society founders produced a greater reduction in haplotype diversity (41%). We find no evidence of genetic bottlenecks between islands of the Hawaiian Archipelago, as expected under a stepping-stone model of colonization, from the initial introduction site. This species rapidly colonized across 2000 km without loss of genetic diversity, illustrating the consequences of introducing highly dispersive marine species.

Using biophysical modelling and genetic analyses, we assessed potential and realized connectivity among MPA populations of a benthic foundation species, the Mediterranean endemic seagrass Posidonia oceanica. Location: Adriatic and Ionian seas (central Mediterranean). Methods: We assessed potential and realized connectivity among eight P.oceanica meadows, mostly located in MPAs. Potential connectivity was assessed over a time horizon of 10years via an individual-based biophysical model whose physical component relies on fine-scale spatio-temporal ocean circulation fields. Genetic assessments of realized connectivity were carried out by means of a set of 14 neutral microsatellite loci, as well as a larger dataset of 19 loci including outlier loci that did not conform to expectations under neutrality. Results: Our findings point out a relatively high potential connectivity through long-range dispersal of floating fruits. Genetic connectivity analyses show a complex scenario with an apparent lower realized connectivity. The P.oceanica meadow within Torre Guaceto MPA (TOG), a well-enforced MPA within our study area, showed one of the highest levels of genotypic richness, indicative of high levels of sexual reproduction and/or recruitment of foreign genotypes. Both biophysical modelling and population genetics indicate that TOG is important to ensure the viability of the species at the local scale, and does likely play a key role as a source of propagules for the whole Adriatic area. Main conclusions: Our results show that realized dispersal does not necessarily match with the potential for dispersal. Still, both genetic and physical connectivity analyses show good agreement in identifying hotspots of connectivity. Such information can guide management of networks of MPAs and advance conservation of marine biodiversity.

Primary candidates for conservation in the region are the Scattered Islands (AZles Aeparses), a group of relatively pristine and uninhabited islands in the Mozambique Channel. However, while optimal conservation strategies depend on the degree of population connectivity among spatially isolated habitats, very few studies have been conducted in the area. Here, we use highly variable microsatellite markers from two damselfishes (Amphiprion akallopisos and Dascyllus trimaculatus) with differing life history traits [pelagic larval duration (PLD), adult habitat] to compare genetic structure and connectivity among these islands using classic population structure indices as well as Bayesian clustering methods. All classical fixation indexes F (ST), R (ST), G'(ST), and Jost's D show stronger genetic differentiation among islands for A. akallopisos compared to D. trimaculatus, consistent with the former species' shorter PLD and stronger adult site attachment, which may restrict larval dispersal potential. In agreement with these results, the Bayesian analysis revealed clear genetic differentiation among the islands in A. akallopisos, separating the southern group (Bassas da India and Europa) from the center (Juan de Nova) and northern (AZles Glorieuses) islands, but not for D. trimaculatus. Local oceanographic patterns such as eddies that occur along the Mozambique Channel appear to parallel the results reported for A. akallopisos, but such features seem to have little effect on the genetic differentiation of D. trimaculatus. The contrasting patterns of genetic differentiation between species within the same family highlight the importance of accounting for diverse life history traits when assessing community-wide connectivity, an increasingly common consideration in conservation planning.

Isolation and characterisation of polymorphic microsatellite loci for studies of the big blue octopus, Octopus cyanea	MARINE BIODIVERSITY			English	Article						Marine invertebrate; Genetic; Biodiversity; Population genetics; Conservation; Management	PCR-RFLP; IDENTIFICATION; SQUID; GRAY	The big blue octopus, Octopus cyanea, occurs on coral reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific region from East Africa to the Hawaiian Islands, wherein it is of great ecological and socio-economic importance. However, many components of its intraspecific biodiversity, such as population structure, are unresolved due to a lack of informative genetic markers. To address this issue, which may compromise conservation and sustainability efforts, the development and characterisation of the first species-specific microsatellite loci for O. cyanea are described here. The eight loci were characterised by the genotyping of 40 adults from Madagascar, which revealed an average of 13.5 alleles per locus (range 9-18). The observed and expected heterozygosity per locus ranged from 0.432 to 0.949 and from 0.481 to 0.989, respectively. No evidence of linkage disequilibrium was detected between pairs of loci. Genotype proportions at six loci conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations, with two loci exhibiting significant heterozygote deficits. These loci are applicable to multiple areas of eco-evolutionary research and, thus, represent a valuable resource for future studies of O. cyanea.

We analyzed the genetic connectivity of Stegastes acapulcoensis between sites of the Mexican Pacific, separated for a maximum geographic distance of 435 km. We assess the genetic differentiation between four sites with four microsatellite loci and traditional estimative methods, having as a result values of F-ST = 0.0017 (p < 0.01) and R-ST = 0.0279 (p < 0.01). Equally, with D-EST and Bayesian methods null or little genetic differentiation between sites was detected. These results are explained considering the dispersal ability of S. acapulcoensis on its pelagic larval stage, which follows the Mexican West Current pattern. Finally, due our results we suggest that it is possible to infer that other demersal fish species may present the same connectivity pattern. The present work constitutes the first evidence that suggests the necessity to join seven priority marine areas of Mexico into a unique continual area.

Direct comparison of mitochondrial markers for the analysis of swordfish population structure	FISHERIES RESEARCH			English	Article						Swordfish; Mitochondria; Control region; Population genetics; Indian Ocean	DNA CONTROL REGION; XIPHIAS-GLADIUS; INDIAN-OCEAN; REPRODUCTIVE DYNAMICS; STATISTICAL TESTS; DIFFERENTIATION; POLYMORPHISM; SOFTWARE; EASTERN	When examining the population structure of swordfish (Xiphias gladius; Linnaeus, 1758) for fisheries management, the traditional marker of choice has been the mitochondrial control region. However, homoplasy within the control region may render it an unsuitable marker. We compared the effectiveness of two mitochondrial markers for examining the population structure between four Indian and one Pacific Ocean sample sites, collected between 2006 and 2009. The control region analysis was unable to detect structure among populations, while ND2 analysis revealed structure between the Seychelles and two other populations, Timor Sea (Phi(ST) = 0.012, P = 0.024) and Coral Sea (Phi(ST) = 0.011, P = 0.029). The level of homoplasy observed in the control region (HI = 0.736) was considerably higher than that of ND2 (HI = 0.290). These results suggest that use of the control region has likely led in an underestimation of genetic differentiation between populations. Genetic markers should be chosen that are appropriate to the scale of subdivision under investigation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we review the genetic patterns and processes that shape the natural populations of marine organisms in Cuba, including penaeid shrimps, reef fishes, marine turtles, and bottlenose dolphins. Investigations performed over the last 20 yrs indicate three general patterns of population structure across the Cuban coast: a north-south break, an east-west split in the south, and local genetic differentiation. These patterns have been shaped by factors that include the size of the island, current patterns, lack of suitable habitats for reproduction, larval recruitment, and foraging behaviors. No single trait can predict dispersal and population structure across these diverse groups, but in every case, there are key life-history features that guide connectivity. These include limited larval dispersal in damselfishes and shrimps, social structure in dolphins, and natal homing in marine turtles. Population genetic partitions can reveal the boundaries of isolated ecosystems, guiding the design of marine protected areas.

A case study in Los Rogues National Park, Venezuela	PEERJ			English	Article						Status; Recovery; Threats; Surveys; Los Rogues; Acropora palmata	WHITE-BAND-DISEASE; TAKE MARINE RESERVES; ST-JOHN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ELKHORN CORAL; REEFS; MANAGEMENT; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; IMPACTS	Eight years ago (2007), the distribution and status of Acropora palmata was quantified throughout Los Rogues archipelago in Venezuela. The aim was to produce a baseline study for this species which combined population genetics with demographic data. The results highlighted that A. palmata had the potential to recover in at least 6 out of 10 sites surveyed. Recovery potential was assumed to be high at sites with a relatively high abundance of the coral, low disease prevalence, high genetic diversity, and high rates of sexual reproduction. However, as noted, Zubillaga et al. (2008) realized recovery was still strongly dependent on local and regional stressors. In 2014 (this study), the status of A. palmata was re-evaluated at Los Rogues. We increased the number of sites from 10 in the original baseline study to 106. This allowed us to assess the population status throughout the entirety of the MPA. Furthermore we also identified local threats that may have hindered population recovery. Here, we show that A. palmata now has a relatively restricted distribution throughout the park, only occurring in 15% of the sites surveyed. Large stands of old dead colonies were common throughout the archipelago; a result which demonstrates that this species has lost almost 50% of its original distribution over the past decades. The majority of corals recorded were large adults (similar to 2 in height), suggesting that these older colonies might be less susceptible or more resilient to local and global threats. However, 45% of these surviving colonies showed evidence of partial mortality and degradation of living tissues. Interestingly, the greatest increase in partial mortality occurred at sites with the lowest levels of protection (X-0(2) = 5.4 > X-c(2) = 4.5; df = 4,p < 0.05) This may suggest there is a positive role of small scale marine management in assisting reef recovery. We also recorded a significant reduction (X-exp(2) = 126.8 > X-cri(2) = 15.5; df = 8; p < 0.05) in the density of A. palmata in XP sites that had previously been categorized as having a high potential for recovery. One explanation for this continued decline may be due to the fact that over the past 10 years, two massive bleaching events have occurred throughout the Caribbean with records showing that Los Rogues has experienced unprecedented declines in overall coral cover. We therefore conclude that although local protection could promote recovery, the impacts from global threats such as ocean warming may hamper the recovery of this threatened species.

There's No Place Like Home: Crown-of-Thorns Outbreaks in the Central Pacific Are Regionally Derived and Independent Events	PLOS ONE			English	Article							STARFISH ACANTHASTER-PLANCI; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; LIMPETS CELLANA SPP.; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; CORAL-REEFS; POPULATION-GENETICS; FEEDING PREFERENCES; HERBIVOROUS FISHES; SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; ECHINODERMATA	One of the most significant biological disturbances on a tropical coral reef is a population outbreak of the fecund, corallivorous crown-of-thorns sea star, Acanthaster planci. Although the factors that trigger an initial outbreak may vary, successive outbreaks within and across regions are assumed to spread via the planktonic larvae released from a primary outbreak. This secondary outbreak hypothesis is predominantly based on the high dispersal potential of A. planci and the assertion that outbreak populations (a rogue subset of the larger population) are genetically more similar to each other than they are to low-density non-outbreak populations. Here we use molecular techniques to evaluate the spatial scale at which A. planci outbreaks can propagate via larval dispersal in the central Pacific Ocean by inferring the location and severity of gene flow restrictions from the analysis of mtDNA control region sequence (656 specimens, 17 non-outbreak and six outbreak locations, six archipelagos, and three regions). Substantial regional, archipelagic, and subarchipelagic-scale genetic structuring of A. planci populations indicate that larvae rarely realize their dispersal potential and outbreaks in the central Pacific do not spread across the expanses of open ocean. On a finer scale, genetic partitioning was detected within two of three islands with multiple sampling sites. The finest spatial structure was detected at Pearl & Hermes Atoll, between the lagoon and forereef habitats (<10 km). Despite using a genetic marker capable of revealing subtle partitioning, we found no evidence that outbreaks were a rogue genetic subset of a greater population. Overall, outbreaks that occur at similar times across population partitions are genetically independent and likely due to nutrient inputs and similar climatic and ecological conditions that conspire to fuel plankton blooms.

Connectivity and resilience of coral reef metapopulations in marine protected areas: matching empirical efforts to predictive needs	CORAL REEFS			English	Article						Connectivity; Larval dispersal; Marine protected areas; Resilience; Replacement; Genetics	LARVAL DISPERSAL; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; SELF-RECRUITMENT; GENE FLOW; FISH; RESERVES; RETENTION; SIGNATURES; SURVIVAL; SUSTAINABILITY	Design and decision-making for marine protected areas (MPAs) on coral reefs require prediction of MPA effects with population models. Modeling of MPAs has shown how the persistence of metapopulations in systems of MPAs depends on the size and spacing of MPAs, and levels of fishing outside the MPAs. However, the pattern of demographic connectivity produced by larval dispersal is a key uncertainty in those modeling studies. The information required to assess population persistence is a dispersal matrix containing the fraction of larvae traveling to each location from each location, not just the current number of larvae exchanged among locations. Recent metapopulation modeling research with hypothetical dispersal matrices has shown how the spatial scale of dispersal, degree of advection versus diffusion, total larval output, and temporal and spatial variability in dispersal influence population persistence. Recent empirical studies using population genetics, parentage analysis, and geochemical and artificial marks in calcified structures have improved the understanding of dispersal. However, many such studies report current self-recruitment (locally produced settlement/settlement from elsewhere), which is not as directly useful as local retention (locally produced settlement/total locally released), which is a component of the dispersal matrix. Modeling of biophysical circulation with larval particle tracking can provide the required elements of dispersal matrices and assess their sensitivity to flows and larval behavior, but it requires more assumptions than direct empirical methods. To make rapid progress in understanding the scales and patterns of connectivity, greater communication between empiricists and population modelers will be needed. Empiricists need to focus more on identifying the characteristics of the dispersal matrix, while population modelers need to track and assimilate evolving empirical results.	[Botsford, L.

Gorgoniapolynoe caeciliae revisited: The discovery of new species and molecular connectivity in deep-sea commensal polynoids from the Central Atlantic	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS			English	Article						Molecular systematics; Integrated taxonomy; Annelida; Symbiosis; Phylogeny; Species delimitation	SCALE-WORMS POLYCHAETA; POPULATION-GENETICS; NORTH-ATLANTIC; ANNELIDA; PHYLOGENY; CORALS; DELIMITATION; ASSOCIATIONS; CORALLIIDAE; DIVERGENCE	Gorgoniapolynoe caeciliae (Fauvel, 1913) is a deep-sea commensal polynoid that lives in association with several genera of octocorals from the order Alcyonacea. The species has been recorded in the Caribbean and in both Atlantic and Indian Ocean basins. The wide geographic range of G. caeciliae, coupled with it having multiple host coral species and the evolution of its taxonomic description, hints that it could potentially be a species complex. This study investigated the morphological and genetic differentiation in 82 specimens of G. cf. caeciliae, sampled from four seamounts in the Central Atlantic separated by thousands of kilometres. Our combined morphological and molecular analyses, including species delimitation models (ABGD and bPTP) using COI and a phylogenetic approach using four molecular markers (COI, 16S, 28S, and 18S), agreed in identifying three distinct species; two supported by morphological and molecular data and a third species, using molecular data only, from the Indian Ocean which had been previously identified as G. caeciliae. We formally describe a new species in the genus, Gorgoniapolynoe pseudocaecliae sp. nov., the most common taxa found in our study. Our morphological analyses of some members of the genus Gorgoniapolynoe revealed the presence of elytra with possible photocytes (bioluminescent cells) and conspicuous macropapillae with long cilia emerging from them, whose function is discussed here. Our demographic analysis using COI for two Gorgoniapolynoe sp. detected a high potential for dispersal for G. pseudocaecliae sp. nov., with sites approximately 3000 km apart being well connected. Unusually there was also no genetic differentiation across their bathymetric range of over 1500 m. All in all, our study highlights the importance of applying integrative taxonomy to poorly studied deep-sea species.

J	Tenggardjaja, KA; Bowen, BW; Bernardi, G				Tenggardjaja, Kimberly A.; Bowen, Brian W.; Bernardi, Giacomo			Vertical and Horizontal Genetic Connectivity in Chromis verater, an Endemic Damselfish Found on Shallow and Mesophotic Reefs in the Hawaiian Archipelago and Adjacent Johnston Atoll	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; POPULATION-GENETICS; CORAL ECOSYSTEMS; CONTROL-REGION; DNA; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; ECOLOGY; EVOLUTION; TRANSPORT; PATTERNS	Understanding vertical and horizontal connectivity is a major priority in research on mesophotic coral ecosystems (30-150 m). However, horizontal connectivity has been the focus of few studies, and data on vertical connectivity are limited to sessile benthic mesophotic organisms. Here we present patterns of vertical and horizontal connectivity in the Hawaiian Islands-Johnston Atoll endemic threespot damselfish, Chromis verater, based on 319 shallow specimens and 153 deep specimens. The mtDNA markers cytochrome b and control region were sequenced to analyze genetic structure: 1) between shallow (<30 m) and mesophotic (30-150 m) populations and 2) across the species' geographic range. Additionally, the nuclear markers rhodopsin and internal transcribed spacer 2 of ribosomal DNA were sequenced to assess connectivity between shallow and mesophotic populations. There was no significant genetic differentiation by depth, indicating high levels of vertical connectivity between shallow and deep aggregates of C. verater. Consequently, shallow and deep samples were combined by location for analyses of horizontal connectivity. We detected low but significant population structure across the Hawaiian Archipelago (overall cytochrome b: Phi(ST)=0.009, P=0.020; control region: Phi(ST)=0.012, P=0.009) and a larger break between the archipelago and Johnston Atoll (cytochrome b: Phi(ST)=0.068, P<0.001; control region: Phi(ST)=0.116, P<0.001). The population structure within the archipelago was driven by samples from the island of Hawaii at the southeast end of the chain and Lisianski in the middle of the archipelago. The lack of vertical genetic structure supports the refugia hypothesis that deep reefs may constitute a population reservoir for species depleted in shallow reef habitats. These findings represent the first connectivity study on a mobile organism that spans shallow and mesophotic depths and provide a reference point for future connectivity studies on mesophotic fishes.

The diploid chromosome number in marine fish varies from 2n= 22-26 to 2n = 240-260. Despite of this apparent diversity, most studied marine species have a diploid complement with 48 acrocentric chromosomes. This latter trend is mostly observed among Perciformes, an important major taxon of coral reef fishes. Studies in the families Pomacentridae, Pomacanthidae and Chaetodontidae, for example, have shown a common karyotype pattern entirely formed by 48 uniarmed chromosomes. However, rare numerical and structural chromosome polymorphisms and cryptic chromosome rearrangements involving heterochromatin segments and/or nucleolar organizing sites have been reported among such fishes. Although new chromosome forms can contribute to the establishment of genetically isolated populations, their role in reef fish speciation at marine realm still is an open question. More recently, genomic DNA analyses using RAPD and microsatellites, and sequencing and RFLP of mitochondrial DNA have increasingly been used in Atlantic reef fish species. Genetic homogeneity over wide geographical ranges has been reported for different fish groups, in contrast to several cases of population substructuring related to environmental constraints or evolutionary history. Amazonas outflow and upwelling on the Southeastern coast of Brazil are believed to be strong barriers to dispersal of some reef species. Moreover, it is suggested that the pattern of speciation and population structure at South Atlantic is quite distinctive from Pacific Ocean, even when comparing closely related taxa. Further genetic studies are strongly encouraged in Brazilian reef fishes in order to provide a reliable scenario of the genetic structure in this important and diverse fish group.

At present, available connectivity information on Mexican Atlantic reefs is scarce, particularly concerning the Veracruz Reef System (VRS), which is located in the south-western Gulf of Mexico. This study used a hierarchically nested sampling design to evaluate the levels of genetic connectivity both within and between the Mexican Caribbean (MC) and VRS reef regions; all of the studied reefs are marine protected areas. Microsatellites were used as genetic markers, and bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) recruits were used as a biological model. The paired genetic differentiation index between regions (Fst ((ENA)) = 0.008) was lower than the global index (Fst ((ENA)) = 0.027), suggesting that the stronger restrictions to gene flow may be located inside the regions rather than between them. The AMOVA results supported this explanation, as the differences were only non-significant between regions. In the VRS, Santiaguillo reef was associated with low genetic connectivity levels, whilst within the MC region the group formed by Chinchorro Bank and Cozumel exhibited a restriction to gene flow with Puerto Morelos, their northernmost reef. Despite their spatial separation, reefs from different regions (Puerto Morelos and Anegada de Adentro) showed the lowest, albeit significant, genetic difference, meaning that a subtle genetic connectivity exists at the regional scale. The detected composite flow pattern is likely related to self-recruitment and cohesive dispersal processes interacting with current patterns, which may favour genetic connections under specific conditions. The results presented here suggest that coral reef management in the Mexican Atlantic Ocean should consider large scale measures in addition to appropriate local actions to protect reef fish populations.

All allozyme loci showed a single very common allele. Allele frequency differences among the locations were mainly found for rare alleles. Genetic distances among the 7 sample sites ranged from less than 0.0001 to 0.012. The fixation index (F-ST) for the allozyme loci was 0.0188. Pairwise single enzyme locus F-ST values were small, but some F-ST values differed significantly from zero. The allozyme analysis detected significant F-ST values between Curacao and the other sample sites. The RAPD data indicated high, but slightly restricted, gene flow among 5 geographic areas. Apparently, dispersal among islands is sufficient to maintain near-homogeneous allele frequencies. We conclude that the local S. viride sub-populations are relatively open and there is a high level of migration among them.

At present there is a lack of quantitative data to determine whether this species is recovering over large spatial scales. Here, we use quantitative surveys conducted in 107 shallow-water reef sites between 2010 and 2012 to investigate the current distribution and abundance of A. palmata along the Mesoamerican Reef System (MRS). Using historical data we also explored how the distribution and abundance of this species has changed in the northern portion of the MRS between 1985 and 2010-2012. A. palmata was recorded in only a fifth of the surveyed reef sites in 2010-2012. In the majority of these reef sites the presence of A. palmata was patchy and rare. Only one site (Limones reef), in the northernmost portion of the MRS, presented considerably high A. palmata cover (mean: 34.7%, SD: 24.5%). At this site, the size-frequency distribution of A. palmata colonies was skewed towards small colony sizes; 84% of the colonies were healthy, however disease prevalence increased with colony size. A comparison with historical data showed that in the northern portion of the MRS, in 1985, A. palmata occurred in 74% of the 31 surveyed sites and had a mean cover of 7.7% (SD = 9.0), whereas in 2010-2012 this species was recorded in 48% of the sites with a mean cover of 2.9% (SD = 7.5). A. palmata populations along the MRS are failing to recover the distribution and abundance they had prior to the 1980s. Investigating the biological (e.g., population genetics) and environmental conditions (e.g., sources of stress) of the few standing reefs with relatively high A. palmata cover is crucial for the development of informed restoration models for this species.

Population genetics and biophysical modeling inform metapopulation connectivity of the Caribbean king crab Maguimithrax spinosissimus	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Crab; Demographic history; Coalescence; Phylogeny	CORAL-REEF FISH; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA VARIATION; LARVAL DISPERSAL; COMPARATIVE PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; MARINE POPULATIONS; SEQUENCE DATA; ATLANTIC; NUCLEAR; GASTROPODA; EVOLUTION	Marine organisms with a short pelagic larval duration (PLD) are assumed to display significant population structure given low long-distance dispersal ability. For the wider Caribbean, theoretical and empirical considerations suggest that species with short PLDs inhabiting each of the following areas should be genetically distinct: Costa Rica (CR), Mexico (MX), and Florida Keys (FL-K), USA. This study tested the hypothesis of significant genetic differentiation in Maguimithrax spinosissimus populations across the wider Caribbean using a combination of biophysical modeling and population genetics. Biophysical modeling predicted dissimilar connectivity patterns among CR, MX, and FL-K depending upon assumed PLD. Eight days of dispersal only provided rare connections from MX to FL-K, and low likelihood multi-generational connections between CR and FL-K. In turn, 12 d of dispersal was sufficient to connect MX to FL-K through direct and indirect routes in biophysical models, but CR and FL-K remained connected only through multiple generational steps. After 16 d of dispersal, direct connections between CR and FL-K may occur, and by 20 d of dispersal, connections are likely between all sampled patches. Population genetic analyses based on partial sequences of the mtDNA 12S, 16S, and COI genes denoted the existence of a single, relatively high-frequency haplotype shared among all 3 populations, which suggests a longer PLD than predicted by laboratory study. In turn, an analysis of molecular variance and pairwise F-ST values demonstrated significant genetic differentiation among the studied populations. Altogether, the above information suggests low to moderate connectivity among populations in M spinosissimus. Subpopulation split predictions suggest multi-generational or stepping-stone connectivity between CR and both MX and FL-K, and provides a framework for understanding the structure of M. spinosissimus metapopulations throughout the region. Overall, this study agrees with the notion of significant population structure in marine species with lower dispersal ability.

To determine if genetic differentiation is evident with more rapidly evolving markers, seven microsatellite loci were screened from the species Gnatholepis anjerensis and G. scapulostigma and population segregation was tested among fish from across the South Pacific. Both AMOVA and pairwise F (ST) analyses showed that, in concordance with previous mitochondrial results, most genetic variance occurs within individual populations, as population differentiation is evident only over the largest distances (> 3,700 km). This result is contrasted with previous studies demonstrating that despite their relatively long larval periods, some gobiid fishes exhibit population differentiation on small (< 100 km) geographic scales. Coalescence analysis showed that current Pacific populations of these species originated in the Pleistocene, presumably related to sea level fluctuations associated with episodes of glaciation. However, rate analysis based on a phylogeny of Gnatholepis species indicates that the species themselves are much older, consistent with a complex history of rapid, short-term population contractions and expansions, with corresponding rapid dispersal.

Corallium rubrum is a precious circum-Mediterranean octocoral. which occurs on rocky reefs between 10 and over 250 m in depth. 2. This species has been harvested for a long time and most commercial populations have been over-exploited. The Mediterranean overall yield was reduced by 66% over the last 15 years. 3. Two type populations may be identified: (a) dense shallow-water populations consisting of small, slow-growing, short-lived colonies and (b) deep-dwelling populations. composed of large, sparse. long-lived colonies. The former populations have little economic value. but should ensure a reproductive stock for the species. 4. While the structure and demography of shallow-water populations have been studied, the demographic parameters of deep-dwelling populations are largely unknown. 5. Recent genetic studies quantified levels of genetic divergence among coastal populations. Estimated numbers of migrants among populations suggested that the planulae of C. rubrum have short-range dispersal. Geographic distances greater than 100 km can be considered as the threshold for genetic divergence between populations. 6. Development of a regime for the sustainable exploitation of this species requires a better knowledge of population dynamics, life-history traits and quantitative genetics, especially concerning commercial populations.

Because these larval stages are potentially subject to dispersal by ocean cur-rents, it has been widely accepted that local populations are open. with recruitment resulting from the arrival of larvae from non-local sources. However, a growing number of studies indicate that larvae are capable of recruiting back to their source population. Here, we review the evidence for self-recruitment in demersal marine populations, drawing from studies of endemism, introduced species, population genetics, stock-recruitment relationships, larval distributions, populations at the limit of a species' range, and applications of environmental and chemical markers. These studies indicate that self-recruitment can and does occur across species representative of most life history traits and geographical localities. Thus, the ability of larvae to recruit back to their natal population may be a pervasive phenomenon among marine species, The mounting evidence in support of self-recruitment dynamics indicates a pressing need for a reevaluation of the appropriateness of demographically-open population models and their applicability to the management and conservation of marine ecosystems.

Going against the flow: Barriers to gene flow impact patterns of connectivity in cryptic coral reef gobies throughout the western Atlantic	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Brazil; Caribbean; Coryphopterus; cryptic species; marine speciation; SNP	POPULATION-GENETICS; SPECIATION; GENOMICS; FISHES; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; DIVERGENCE; INFERENCE; COASTAL; TOOL	Aim Complex oceanographic features have historically caused difficulty in understanding gene flow in marine taxa. Here, we evaluate the impact of potential phylogeographic barriers to gene flow and assess demography and evolutionary history of a coral reef goby species complex. Specifically, we test how the Amazon River outflow and ocean currents impact gene flow. Location Western Atlantic. Taxon The bridled goby (Coryphopterus glaucofraenum) and sand-canyon goby (C. venezuelae) species complex. Methods We used mitochondrial DNA and 2,401 genomic SNPs to investigate evolutionary history and test hypotheses of how major barriers impact species-level differentiation. We used clustering algorithms and pairwise F-ST to assess population differentiation caused by minor barriers within and among regions. Finally, we tested alternate hypotheses of demographic history via coalescent simulations to determine the most plausible spread across the Western Atlantic. Results We found two unique clades of C. glaucofraenum along the Brazilian coast and the oceanic island Atol das Rocas (AR) that are more closely related to C. venzuelae. Further genetic structure within the Caribbean and separately along the Brazilian coast led to at least two distinct populations in each Province. Coalescent simulations indicated that an ancestral population of C. venezuelae split from C. glaucofraenum in the Caribbean, dispersed to Brazil, then spread to AR. Main conclusions Species-level genetic differentiation has resulted from the Amazon River outflow and isolation of AR. Population differentiation within the Caribbean matched previous studies indicating an east-west pattern of divergence. Brazilian population differentiation was impacted by the cold-water upwelling filter at Cabo Frio. Overall, this research highlights how barriers to gene flow impact speciation and genetic structure within western Atlantic gobies and provides insight into the role oceanographic features have in the speciation process of fishes.

Spatial Subdivision and Genetic Diversity in Populations on the East and West Coasts of Australia: The Multi-Faceted Case of Nautilus pompilius (Mollusca, Cephalopoda)	REVIEWS IN FISHERIES SCIENCE			English	Article						Nautilus; coxI; spatial subdivision; Great Barrier Reef; Western Australia; population genetics	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; L. CEPHALOPODA; PHYLOGENY; BARCODE; CONSERVATION; PLEISTOCENE; RHINOPHORE; TENTACLES; PRIMERS	The fragmented distribution of Nautilus pompilius and its biology suggest there will be significant genetic divergence and spatial subdivision between east and west Australian populations. Samples were collected from the northern Great Barrier Reef, the Coral Sea, and the Scott Reef off Western Australia. Phylogenetic trees and a minimum spanning tree were developed from these data to elucidate evolutionary relationships. These data demonstrate significant evolutionary separation of each of the three populations into strongly supported discrete clades matching geographic stratification. Within each of the discrete populations, genetic variation is evident. Strong inter-population variation is evident, with discrete geographic clades being recognized for each extant group. The distinct spatial subdivision between east and west Australian populations of Nautilus are related to geographic and physical isolation over evolutionary time, and this has important fisheries management implications. The distinct geographic patterns of genetic structuring demonstrated by these data indicate the existence of discrete eastern and western Australian management units, and as such, these Nautilus populations should be managed discretely, as each has a high conservation value containing unique genetic variation.

Genetic isolation-by-distance (IBD) patterns can be used for estimating dispersal, and these patterns are especially useful for marine species in which few other methods are available. In this study, we genotyped coral reef fish (Amphiprion biaculeatus) at 16 microsatellite loci across eight sites across 210 km in the central Philippines to generate fine-scale estimates of dispersal. All sites except for one followed IBD patterns. Using IBD theory, we estimated a larval dispersal kernel spread of 8.9 km (95% confidence interval of 2.3-18.4 km). Genetic distance to the remaining site correlated strongly with the inverse probability of larval dispersal from an oceanographic model. Ocean currents were a better explanation for genetic distance at large spatial extents (sites greater than 150 km apart), while geographic distance remained the best explanation for spatial extents less than 150 km. Our study demonstrates the utility of combining IBD patterns with oceanographic simulations to understand connectivity in marine environments and to guide marine conservation strategies.

Dongsha Atoll is an important stepping-stone that promotes regional genetic connectivity in the South China Sea	PEERJ			English	Article						Indo-Pacific; Migration models; Larval dispersal; Marine connectivity; Phylogeography; Marine metapopulations; Stepping-stones	PELAGIC LARVAL DURATION; POPULATION-GENETICS; INDO-PACIFIC; POMACENTRUS-COELESTIS; R PACKAGE; MARINE; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; CONSERVATION; COALESCENT; DISPERSAL	Background: Understanding region-wide patterns of larval connectivity and gene flow is crucial for managing and conserving marine biodiversity. Dongsha Atoll National Park (DANP), located in the northern South China Sea (SCS), was established in 2007 to study and conserve this diverse and remote coral atoll. However, the role of Dongsha Atoll in connectivity throughout the SCS is seldom studied. In this study, we aim to evaluate the role of DANP in conserving regional marine biodiversity. Methods: In total, 206 samples across nine marine species were collected and sequenced from Dongsha Atoll, and these data were combined with available sequence data from each of these nine species archived in the Genomic Observatories Metadatabase (GEOME). Together, these data provide the most extensive population genetic analysis of a single marine protected area. We evaluate metapopulation structure for each species by using a coalescent sampler, selecting among panmixia, stepping-stone, and island models of connectivity in a likelihood-based framework. We then completed a heuristic graph theoretical analysis based on maximum dispersal distance to get a sense of Dongsha's centrality within the SCS. Results: Our dataset yielded 111 unique haplotypes across all taxa at DANP, 58% of which were not sampled elsewhere. Analysis of metapopulation structure showed that five out of nine species have strong regional connectivity across the SCS such that their gene pools are effectively panmictic (mean pelagic larval duration (PLD) = 78 days, sd = 60 days); while four species have stepping-stone metapopulation structure, indicating that larvae are exchanged primarily between nearby populations (mean PLD = 37 days, sd = 15 days). For all but one species, Dongsha was ranked within the top 15 out of 115 large reefs in the South China Sea for betweenness centrality. Thus, for most species, Dongsha Atoll provides an essential link for maintaining stepping-stone gene flow across the SCS. Conclusions: This multispecies study provides the most comprehensive examination of the role of Dongsha Atoll in marine connectivity in the South China Sea to date. Combining new and existing population genetic data for nine coral reef species in the region with a graph theoretical analysis, this study provides evidence that Dongsha Atoll is an important hub for sustaining connectivity for the majority of coral-reef species in the region.

Genetic surfing, not allopatric divergence, explains spatial sorting of mitochondrial haplotypes in venomous coralsnakes	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Directionality index psi; Elapidae; heterozygosity; mitonuclear discordance; private alleles; RADseq; serial founder effect	POPULATION-GENETICS; RANGE EXPANSION; WAVE-FRONT; MUTATIONS; INFERENCE; SELECTION; DISTANCE; FLOW; COALESCENT; DIVERSITY	Strong spatial sorting of genetic variation in contiguous populations is often explained by local adaptation or secondary contact following allopatric divergence. A third explanation, spatial sorting by stochastic effects of range expansion, has been considered less often though theoretical models suggest it should be widespread, if ephemeral. In a study designed to delimit species within a clade of venomous coralsnakes, we identified an unusual pattern within the Texas coral snake (Micrurus tener): strong spatial sorting of divergent mitochondrial (mtDNA) lineages over a portion of its range, but weak sorting of these lineages elsewhere. We tested three alternative hypotheses to explain this pattern-local adaptation, secondary contact following allopatric divergence, and range expansion. Collectively, near panmixia of nuclear DNA, the signal of range expansion associated sampling drift, expansion origins in the Gulf Coast of Mexico, and species distribution modeling suggest that the spatial sorting of divergent mtDNA lineages within M. tener has resulted from genetic surfing of standing mtDNA variation-not local adaptation or allopatric divergence. Our findings highlight the potential for the stochastic effects of recent range expansion to mislead estimations of population divergence made from mtDNA, which may be exacerbated in systems with low vagility, ancestral mtDNA polymorphism, and male-biased dispersal.

This study aimed to investigate the haplotype diversity and genetic connectivity of the coastal horseshoe crab (Tachypleus gigas) in Indonesia. To achieve this, we collected a total of 91 samples from six main T. gigas habitats: Bintan, Balikpapan, Demak, Madura, Subang, and Ujung Kulon. The samples were amplified using primers for mitochondrial (mt) AT-rich region DNA sequences. The results showed 34 haplotypes, including seven shared and 22 unique haplotypes, across all localities. The pairwise genetic differentiation (FST) values were low (0 to 0.13) and not significantly different (p>0:05), except among samples from Ujung Kulon-Madura and Kulon-Subang (p<0:05). Additionally, the 34 analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed the most variation within populations (95.23%) compared to less among populations (4.77%). The haplotype network showed evidence of shared haplotypes between populations. Tajima's D and Fu's FS test values indicated a population expansion. Our results showed a low level of differentiation, suggesting a single stock and high connectivity.

The red lionfish (Pterois volitans) and devil fire-fish (Pterois miles) are invasive species that pose a threat to the biodiversity and stability of coral reefs in the Western Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. Species identification of lionfish is uncertain in some parts of Cuba, and research has mainly been focused on their biology and ecology. The principal aim of this study was to determine highly polymorphic markers (Inter Simple Sequence Repeat, ISSR) that could be used in research on lionfish population genetics in addition to confirming the presence of Pterois species in the Guanahacabibes National Park. The genetic profile or "fingerprint" of individuals collected in Mexico, formally identified as P. volitans, was compared with the genetic profile of specimens from Cuba. There were very few "diagnostic bands" and a high number of "common bands", demonstrating that the same species exists in both countries. Furthermore, Nei's genetic distance and the unrooted tree do not show significant differences between both localities. In light of these results, we can confirm the presence of P. volitans in the Guanahacabibes National Park, Cuba. This study demonstrates the functionality of ISSR as a molecular tool for species identification and their application for genetic population studies of this invasive fish species.

The present study aimed at assessing the connectivity levels of subpopulations of bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) recruits at a small scale (similar to 200 km) among four reefs in the Mexican Caribbean. Samples were collected from 13 sites nested in two Marine Parks (Cozumel and Xcalak), one Biosphere Reserve (Chinchorro Bank) and one unprotected area (Mahahual). A total of 713 samples were genetically characterized by means of seven microsatellite DNA markers and were analyzed on a hierarchical basis. A strong genetic structure was detected among sites with a weak but significant genetic structure among reefs, the combination of which has not been reported in previous studies. These results appear to be related to a "sweepstake-chance effect" combined with oceanographic factors. An isolation by distance test, in addition to a hierarchical Bayesian method, revealed that neither distance among sites and reefs nor any of 10 environmental factors tested could be used to explain the genetic differences observed. The results suggest that conservation strategies for S. partitus based on local scales are likely to be effective.	[Villegas-Sanchez, C. A.; Arias-Gonzalez, J.

In the ocean, most estimates suggesting short-distance dispersal are based on direct ecological observations of dispersing individuals, while indirect evolutionary estimates often suggest substantially greater homogeneity among populations. Reconciling these two approaches and their seemingly competing perspectives on dispersal has been a major challenge. Here we show for the first time that evolutionary and ecological measures of larval dispersal can closely agree by using both to estimate the distribution of dispersal distances. In orange clownfish (Amphiprion percula) populations in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, we found that evolutionary dispersal kernels were 17 km (95% confidence interval: 12-24 km) wide, while an exhaustive set of direct larval dispersal observations suggested kernel widths of 27 km (19-36 km) or 19 km (15-27 km) across two years. The similarity between these two approaches suggests that ecological and evolutionary dispersal kernels can be equivalent, and that the apparent disagreement between direct and indirect measurements can be overcome. Our results suggest that carefully applied evolutionary methods, which are often less expensive, can be broadly relevant for understanding ecological dispersal across the tree of life.

Discriminant function analysis (DFA) of 9 melanistic traits in the head region resulted in clear separation between Bimini and the other 3 populations. South Florida, St. Thomas, and Aruba slightly overlapped in patterning, with St. Thomas forming the transition between South Florida and Aruba. DFA of 17 morphometric characters elucidated differentiation among the 4 populations with some overlap between populations. Analysis of concatenated cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and mitochondrial control region (mtCR) sequences revealed substantial differences among O. aurifrons populations (pairwise Phi(ST) = 0.185-0.566), although there was a lack of reciprocal monophyly. Differences in patterning and morphometrics constituted different phenotypes that predominated in each location, with high levels of genetic differentiation between sampled populations. Bimini was most divergent in phenotype, while Aruba was most divergent in genetics. As such, variations in phenotype and genetics are not congruent for O. aurifrons investigated in this study.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the existence of structured populations (i.e. genetic unities) along a coast of approximately 2000 km of the NE Brazilian coast. The transferability of 17 primers synthesized for Scarus rubroviolaceus was tested for S. trispinosus and five transferable loci were validated and used. Two localities within the Abrolhos Bank, off the Central Brazilian coast (Corumbau and Caravelas) and in close proximity to the MPA, which encompasses the largest remnants of the S. trispinosus population, exhibited higher levels of genetic richness. Remaining locations, Pernambuco, Porto Seguro and Rio Grande do Norte exhibited lower genetic diversity. We found no genetic differences among sampled localities however, when those samples were gathered into latitudinal groups (northern vs southern) a subtle but significant genetic substructuring was revealed. It is proposed that a combination of high local individual admixture favoured by habitat connectivity drived genetic homogeneity at regional scales while larval dispersal contributed to heterogeneities observed at large scales maintaining gene flow through oceanographic currents.

However, a detailed study comparing their basic population genetic structures using more than a single type of genetic marker has not been conducted. Through such a study, key phylogeographic, taxonomic, and fisheries issues can be addressed. We used variation in allozyme loci and mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms to evaluate and compare the population genetic structures of bay scallops from those two regions, to propose a new interpretation for the composition of the North Carolina bay scallop population, to resolve the taxonomic quandary of Argopecten irradians taylorae, and to evaluate the apparent and potential genetic effects of the common fishery practice of hatchery-based stock enhancement on the genetic diversity and relatedness of Atlantic bay scallop populations. Atlantic Ocean (North Carolina through New York) bay scallop populations are genetically more distant from each other than are Florida Gulf bay scallop populations, except those in Florida Bay. Each Atlantic population has a different phylogeographic history, is quasi-independent, and should be treated as a genetically unique entity. The North Carolina bay scallop population is composed of Argopecten irradians irradians individuals, but also has genetic input from Argopecten irradians concentricus. Bay scallops occurring in Florida Bay constitute a population of A. i. concentricus that has diverged from other Florida Gulf populations because it has undergone repeated contractions and expansions of varying magnitude and is nearly isolated from other bay scallop populations. For the common practice of hatchery-based stock enhancement in the Atlantic, broodstock bay scallops should be taken from the same genetic population, and all stock enhancement efforts should include comprehensive genetic monitoring programs. In some cases, improving the abundance and density of bay scallop aggregations through habitat improvement may be preferable to stock enhancement for bay scallop restoration, but in other cases genetically conscientious stock supplementation or restoration may be the only alternative.

In this chapter, we focus on the recurrent and large scale mass mortality events (MMEs) induced by marine heatwaves (MHWs), and their immediate and long-term impacts on structural octocorals from highly diverse coralligenous communities. By combining an accurate characterization of present and expected thermal stress conditions in coastal seawater from the surface down to 40 m depth with the state of the art on demography, population genetics, and responses to thermal stress, we analyze the ongoing eco-evolutionary impacts and explore future trajectories of these emblematic Mediterranean communities. Analysis of satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) trends over the three decades revealed a marked increase in MHW events in the Mediterranean Sea. The immediate impacts of MMEs on structural octocoral populations were dramatic decreases of their biomass (similar to 60%). After 10-15 years since the occurrence of a NHW, there were no signs of population recovery, and in fact, a continued decrease was observed due to subsequent marine heatwaves. The modeling of Mediterranean SST suggests longer and more severe marine heatwaves as the century progresses. In this thermal context, the eco-evolutionary dynamics of the structural octocorals will likely result in an abrupt collapse of impacted populations. Indeed, from the eco-evolutionary interaction, the demographic decline is expected to increase the strength of genetic drift due to the low recolonization capacity of the species. This may lead to an extinction vortex, in spite of the occurrence of potentially thermoresistant individuals suggesting some potential for adaptation to future conditions. The ongoing collapse of Mediterranean habitat-forming octocorals may drive to a functional void with severe consequences for coralligenous communities and services they provide. The implementation of ambitious mitigation and adaptation policies compliant with the Paris agreement is urgently needed. In this context, we highlight the critical role of marine protected areas and the need for increasing their surface and improving their management.

A total of 727 Acanthurus triostegus collected from 15 locations throughout the Pacific were analyzed for 20 polymorphic loci. The genetic structure showed limited internal disequilibrium within each population; 3.7% of the loci showed significant Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium, mostly associated with Adh*, and we subsequently removed this locus from further analysis of geographic pattern. The genetic structure of A. triostegus throughout the tropical Pacific Ocean revealed a strong geographic pattern. Overall, there was significant population differentiation (multilocus F-ST = 0.199), which was geographically structured according to bootstraps of neighbor-joining analysis on Nei's unbiased genetic distances and AMOVA analysis. The genetic structure revealed five geographic groups in the Pacific Ocean: western Pacific (Guam, Philippines, Palau, and Great Barrier Reef); central Pacific (Solomons, New Caledonia, and Fiji): and three groups made up of the eastern populations, namely Hawaiian Archipelago (north), Marquesas (equatorial), and southern French Polynesia (south) that incorporates Clipperton Island located in the northeastern Pacific. In addition, heterozygosity values were found to be geographically structured with higher values grouped within Polynesian and Clipperton populations, which exhibited lower population size. Finally, the genetic differentiation (F-ST) was significantly correlated with geographic distance when populations from the Hawaiian and Marquesas archipelagos were separated from all the other locations. These results show that patterns of differentiation vary within the same species according to the spatial scale, with one group probably issued from vicariance. whereas the other followed a pattern of isolation by distance. The geographic pattern for A. triostegus emphasizes the diversity of the evolutionary processes that lead to the present genetic structure with some being more influential in certain areas or according to a particular spatial scale.

LocationRed Sea, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman and Arabian Gulf. MethodsMitochondrial DNA cytochrome-c oxidase subunit-I and nuclear DNA (S7) sequences were obtained for C. hemistiktos sampled throughout its distributional range. Phylogeographical and population-level analyses were used to assess patterns of genetic structure and to identify barriers to dispersal. Concurrently, age-based demographic analyses using otoliths determined differences in growth and longevity between regions. ResultsOur analyses revealed significant genetic structure congruent with growth parameter differences observed across sampling sites, suggesting cryptic speciation between populations in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden versus the Gulf of Oman and Arabian Gulf. Coalescence analyses indicated these two regions have been isolated for >800,000years. Main conclusionsOur results indicate historical disruption to gene flow and a contemporary dispersal barrier in the Arabian Sea, which C. hemistiktos larvae are unable to effectively traverse. This provides yet another example of a (cryptic) species with high dispersive potential whose range is delimited by a lack of suitable habitat between locations or an inability to successfully recruit at the range edge.

J	Costas, E; Rodas, VL				Costas, Eduardo; Lopez Rodas, Victoria			The role of phytoplankton in climate change: depends our future of some small microalgae?	ANALES DE LA REAL ACADEMIA NACIONAL DE FARMACIA			Spanish	Review						Climatic change; CO2; phytoplankton; photosynthesis		Nowadays, we are living in a rapid global change period in which around 30,000 species go extinct annually due to those human activities that are altering biosphere-level biogeochemistry processes. Biosphere level cycles may become less predictable as essential microbes succumb to climatic change and anthropogenic activities. In particular, since microalgae and cyanobacteria play an important role in control of global change because they are the principal primary producers of aquatic ecosystems producing around 50% total photosynthesis. Balance between respiration -oxidation (C6H12O6 + 6 O-2 double right arrow 6 CO2 + 6 H2O) and photosynthesis (6 CO2 + 6 H2O double right arrow C6H12O6 + 6 O-2) is the pacemaker of CO2 and consequently of climatic change. Investigating the differential capacity of the response of phytoplankton to human-induced environmental forcing has become a key issue to understanding further the future repercussions on the functioning of ecosystems at planetary level. Our studies show that different functional phytoplanktonic groups (ie. oceanic, coastal, coral-simbionts, continental phytoplankton...) have very different capability for adaptation to global change. The capacity of different microalgal species to adapt to global change can be explained in relation to population genetics structure, growth rate, mutation rate, ploidy, habitat preference and taxonomic group. Populations of oceanic microalgae showed the minimal capacity to adapt to change. Since open ocean is the biggest ecosystem on the Earth, future perspectives are not good.

Connectivity between spawning aggregations is thus assured by larval dispersal. This study looks into the genetic structure and gene flow among spawning aggregations of a large grouper, the gulf coney Hyporthodus acanthistius, in the northern Gulf of California. First, using the mitochondrial control region and 11 microsatellites, we calculated F-ST metrics and conducted a Bayesian clustering analysis to determine structure among 5 spawning aggregations. Shallow genetic structure was found, separating the southernmost spawning aggregate from the remainder. Second, we used the results from the structure analysis and local water circulation patterns to delineate 3 distinct models of gene flow. The best-supported model, in which the southernmost spawning aggregate formed one group and all other spawning aggregates were nested into a second group, was the one that was consistent with water circulation during the species' spawning season. Larval retention within a seasonal anti cyclonic gyre that formed during the gulf coney's spawning season may be responsible for the patterns found. This study highlights the importance of local oceanographic conditions in dictating the structure among spawning aggregations even at small geographic scales and contributes to informed management plans for this overexploited grouper.

However, little is known about the seagrasses in the Indo-West Pacific Ocean, where the world's highest diversity of seagrasses occurs. The influence of sea currents on these populations is also unknown. We estimated the genetic diversity and population genetic structure and identified reproductive features in Enhalus acoroides populations from the Yaeyama Islands, Hainan Island and the Philippines. The Philippines are situated at the centre of the E.acoroides range, Yaeyama and Hainan are peripheral populations, and the Yaeyama population is at the northern limit of the species range. The powerful Kuroshio Current flows from the Philippines to Yaeyama. Genetic analyses using nine microsatellite markers indicated that reproduction of E.acoroides is mostly sexual. Clonal diversity does not decrease in northern populations, although genetic diversity does. However, the genetic diversity of the Yaeyama populations is greater than that of the Hainan populations. Significant genetic differentiation among most populations was evident; however, the Yaeyama and north-east Philippines populations were genetically similar, despite being separated by similar to 1100km. An assignment test suggested that recruitment occurs from the north-east Philippines to Yaeyama. The strong current in this region is probably responsible for the extant genetic diversity and recruitment patterns.

Hybridization is an important evolutionary phenomenon contributing to biodiversity within marine systems, where hybrid zones provide ideal systems in which to study hybridization events. Here, a suite of 42 Amphiprion microsatellite markers (including development of 8 novel markers) were cross-amplified in individuals from parent taxa and hybrid populations to facilitate investigation into the relatedness of hybridizing species across the A. leucokranos hybrid zone. Analysis revealed 15, 20 and 24 highly polymorphic loci (PIC>0.5) in the two parent species and hybrid, respectively, for use in population genetic and parentage studies, with 305 unique alleles found overall (ranging from 1 to 13 alleles per locus) and 7 alleles per locus on average. Observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.000 to 1.000 and 0.000 to 0.978, respectively. Significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were found in eight loci, possibly due to relatedness among samples or the presence of null alleles. Use of the suite of markers tested here will provide valuable insights into the contemporary population structure and introgression among species and hybrids within the Amphiprion leucokranos hybrid zone, as well as inform future ecological and evolutionary studies of anemonefishes more broadly.

To elucidate the gene flow of A. planci across the Indo-Pacific in relation to ocean currents and to test the larval dispersal hypothesis, the genetic structure among 23 samples over the Indo-Pacific was analysed using seven highly polymorphic microsatellite loci. The F-statistics and genetic admixture analysis detected genetically distinct groups in accordance with ocean current systems, that is, the Southeast African group (Kenya and Mayotte), the Northwestern Pacific group (the Philippines and Japan), Palau, the North Central Pacific group (Majuro and Pohnpei), the Great Barrier Reef, Fiji, and French Polynesia, with a large genetic break between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. A pattern of significant isolation by distance was observed among all samples (P = 0.001, r = 0.88, n = 253, Mantel test), indicating restricted gene flow among the samples in accordance with geographical distances. The data also indicated strong gene flow within the Southeast African, Northwestern Pacific, and Great Barrier Reef groups. These results suggest that the western boundary currents have strong influence on gene flow of this species and may trigger secondary outbreaks.

Generally, species with long-lived planktonic larvae are expected to exhibit wider distribution patterns than those species which brood their young, due to their presumably greater potential for dispersal. In some cases, however, brooding species exhibit broad distributions and show evidence of genetic exchange with geographically distant populations. One potential factor that has been invoked as an explanation is dispersal by floating and rafting of adults and egg masses. Several studies have shown that it is possible for sessile adults to disperse on the order of several to many thousand kilometers by rafting on debris in ocean currents. With very few exceptions, however, direct evidence of rafting in the open ocean has been lacking. We present evidence of long-distance (1300 to 2000 km) dispersal of a brooding pelecypod, Gaimardia trapesina (Lamarck, 1819), in the Southern Ocean in the vicinity of Cape Horn, the Falkland Islands, and the antarctic island South Georgia (54 degrees S; 37 degrees W). Data on survival and fecundity rates of G. trapesina and the prevalence of kelp rafts collected during the austral winter of 1993 indicate that dispersal by rafting can occur over ecologically relevant time scales and could potentially serve as a significant means of genetic exchange between populations.

Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia 41 (1889) 102] has a widespread distribution over the Western Atlantic, where it has been reported from Bermuda and Bahamas to southern Brazil. Nonetheless, reproductive features of this species, which broods asexually produced offspring, suggest that it has low dispersal capabilities. This raises a question about the specific status of the Brazilian population of A. bermudensis. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the taxonomic status of the Brazilian population, by genetically comparing it with the type locality (Bermuda) population. For this, we used allozyme electrophoresis to analyze samples from both populations. Thirteen enzyme systems (16 loci) yielded interpretable results for all populations. A high differentiation was encountered for the Western Atlantic A. bermudensis population (F-ST=0.434), partially due to the presence of a diagnostic locus (LAP) between Bermuda and Brazilian populations. This result could be taken as an indication that the Brazilian population should be elevated to a specific status. We do expect some genetic differentiation, however, between natural populations separated over wide geographic distances. Finally, since Mantel and regression analyses did not rule out the isolation by distance model, we have conservatively decided to maintain the specific status of A. bermudensis from Brazil.

These patterns have been described in marine species with free-living larvae, but are unexpected because they occur at a scale below the dispersal range of pelagic larvae. At the scale where most larvae are immigrants, theory predicts spatially homogeneous, temporally stable genetic variation. Empirical studies have suggested that genetic drift interacts with complex dispersal patterns to create chaotic genetic patchiness. Here we use a coancestry model and individual-based simulations to test this idea. We found that chaotic genetic patterns (qualified by global FST and spatio-temporal variation in FST's between pairs of samples) arise from the combined effects of (1) genetic drift created by the small local effective population sizes of the sessile phase and variance in contribution among breeding groups and (2) collective dispersal of related individuals in the larval phase. Simulations show that patchiness levels qualitatively comparable to empirical results can be produced by a combination of strong variance in reproductive success and mild collective dispersal. These results call for empirical studies of the effective number of breeders producing larval cohorts, and population genetics at the larval stage.

Here, we focus on a case of hybridization between the sympatric sister-species Haemulon maculicauda and H. flaviguttatum, using Sanger sequencing of mitochondrial and nuclear loci, as well as 2422 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained via restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADSeq). Mitochondrial markers revealed a shared haplotype for COI and low divergence for CytB and CR between the sister-species. On the other hand, complete lineage sorting was observed at the nuclear loci and most of the SNPs. Under neutral expectations, the smaller effective population size of mtDNA should lead to fixation of mutations faster than nDNA. Thus, these results suggest that hybridization in the recent past (0.174-0.263Ma) led to introgression of the mtDNA, with little effect on the nuclear genome. Analyses of the SNP data revealed 28 loci potentially under divergent selection between the two species. The combination of mtDNA introgression and limited nuclear DNA introgression provides a mechanism for the evolution of independent lineages despite recurrent hybridization events. This study adds to the growing body of research that exemplifies how genetic divergence can be maintained in the presence of gene flow between closely related species.

Examination of genetic isolation by distance, in which close populations are more similar than distant ones, has the potential to increase confidence in the significance of slight genetic differentiation. Simulations of one-dimensional stepping stone populations with particular larval dispersal regimes shows that isolation by distance is most obvious when comparing populations separated by 2-5 times the mean larval dispersal distance. Available data on fish and invertebrates can be calibrated with this simulation approach and suggest mean dispersal distances of 25-150 km. Design of marine reserve systems requires an understanding of larval transport in and out of reserves, whether reserves will be self-seeding, whether they will accumulate recruits from surrounding exploited areas, and whether reserve networks can exchange recruits. Direct measurements of mean larval dispersal are needed to understand connectivity in a reserve system, but such measurements are extremely difficult. Genetic patterns of isolation by distance have the potential to add to direct measurement of larval dispersal distance and can help set the appropriate geographic scales on which marine reserve systems will function well.

Because of its high fecundity and the long duration of the pelagic larval stage, the mechanism of outbreaks may be related to its meta-population dynamics, which should be examined by larval sampling and population genetic analysis. However, A. planci larvae have undistinguished morphological features compared with other asteroid larvae, hence it has been difficult to discriminate A. planci larvae in plankton samples without species-specific markers. Also, no tools are available to reveal the dispersal pathway of A. planci larvae. Therefore the development of highly polymorphic genetic markers has the potential to overcome these difficulties. To obtain genomic information for these purposes, the complete nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial genome of A. planci and its putative sibling species, A. brevispinus were determined and their characteristics discussed. Results: The complete mtDNA of A. planci and A. brevispinus are 16,234 bp and 16,254 bp in size, respectively. These values fall within the length variation range reported for other metazoan mitochondrial genomes. They contain 13 proteins, 2 rRNA, and 22 tRNA genes and the putative control region in the same order as the asteroid, Asterina pectinifera. The A + T contents of A. planci and A. brevispinus on their L strands that encode the majority of protein-coding genes are 56.3% and 56.4% respectively and are lower than that of A. pectinifera (61.2%). The percent similarity of nucleotide sequences between A. planci and A. brevispinus is found to be highest in the CO2 and CO3 regions ( both 90.6%) and lowest in ND2 gene (84.2%) among the 13 protein-coding genes. In the deduced putative amino acid sequences, CO1 is highly conserved (99.2%), and ATP8 apparently evolves faster any of the other protein-coding gene (85.2%). Conclusion: The gene arrangement, base composition, codon usage and tRNA structure of A. planci are similar to those of A. brevispinus. However, there are significant variations between A. planci and A. brevispinus. Complete mtDNA sequences are useful for the study of phylogeny, larval detection and population genetics.

J	Gonzalez, C; Gallagher, AJ; Caballero, S				Gonzalez, Cindy; Gallagher, Austin J.; Caballero, Susana			Conservation genetics of the bonnethead shark Sphyrna tiburo in Bocas del Toro, Panama: Preliminary evidence of a unique stock	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SCALLOPED HAMMERHEAD SHARK; NORTH-ATLANTIC OCEAN; GULF-OF-MEXICO; POPULATION-GENETICS; CORAL-REEFS; FISHERIES MANAGEMENT; MICROSATELLITE LOCI; CRYPTIC SPECIATION; BLACKTIP SHARK; MITOCHONDRIAL	The bonnethead shark, Sphyrna tiburo, is a small elasmobranch distributed in the Eastern Pacific from southern California to Ecuador, and along the Western Atlantic, with preferences for continental margins of North, Central and South America, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean. Recent studies have suggested that it could be under a process of cryptic speciation, with the possibility to find different species in similar geographic locations. Here we assessed the population structure and genetic diversity of this highly philopatric and non-dispersive species in the Bocas del Toro Archipelago, Panama. Fragments of the mitochondrial genes cytochrome oxidase I and control region, were used to test the genetic structure of adult and juvenile S. tiburo in this area, and were compared with other locations of the Western Atlantic and Belize. We found significant genetic differentiation between Caribbean bonnethead sharks from Bocas del Toro and Belize, when compared to bonnetheads from other locations of the Western Atlantic. These results also suggest that Bocas del Toro could constitute a different genetic population unit for this species, whereby bonnethead sharks in this area could belong to a unique stock. The information obtained in this study could improve our understanding of the population dynamics of the bonnethead shark throughout its distribution range, and may be used as a baseline for future conservation initiatives for coastal sharks in Central America, a poorly studied an often overlooked region for shark conservation and research.

J	Tenggardjaja, KA; Bowen, BW; Bernardi, G				Tenggardjaja, Kimberly A.; Bowen, Brian W.; Bernardi, Giacomo			Comparative phylogeography of widespread and endemic damselfishes in the Hawaiian Archipelago	MARINE BIOLOGY			English	Article							CORAL-REEF FISH; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; PELAGIC LARVAL DURATION; POPULATION-GENETICS; RANGE-SIZE; REVEALS ISOLATION; SELF-RECRUITMENT; RED-SEA; PACIFIC; CONNECTIVITY	The Hawaiian Archipelago, one of the most remote archipelagoes in the world, is a hotspot for reef fish endemism. The restricted biogeographic range sizes of endemic species have been interpreted to indicate low dispersal ability, whereas broad distributions of widespread species are assumed to indicate high dispersal potential. To assess that intuitive link, we analyzed mitochondrial cytochrome b and control region sequence data for two widespread damselfish species (Abudefduf vaigiensis and Chromis vanderbilti) across the Hawaiian Archipelago and broader Indo-Pacific and compared with three Hawaiian endemic damselfishes (A. abdominalis, C. ovalis, and C. verater). The widespread species exhibited less population structure in the Hawaiian Archipelago than the endemics. Across the larger spatial scale of their Indo-Pacific ranges, both widespread damselfish species showed strong and significant population structure. Our comparison of widespread and endemic damselfish species is consistent with the expected trend for widespread species to exhibit more connectivity within the Hawaiian Archipelago, but this pattern may be restricted to certain reef fish families. In addition, widespread species in this study and previous studies, which had little to no population subdivision within archipelagoes, have shown strong genetic structure when analyzed across the broader Indo-Pacific. We conclude that geographic range size may be a better indicator of dispersal ability at smaller (within archipelago) rather than at larger spatial scales (across oceans). Management should note that reef fishes unique to Hawaii seem to have less gene flow across the archipelago than more broadly distributed Indo-Pacific species.

While aquaculture is seen as an alternative to fisheries and as a mean to restore wild populations, more knowledge is needed on their reproductive strategies to render this practice efficient, notably for fissiparous holothurians, which are some of the mobile animals able of asexual reproduction by transverse fission. Little information is available on their population genetic diversity and structure. Here, the clonal structure of populations of the fissiparous sea cucumber Stichopus chloronotus has been investigated using nine microsatellite loci and a random sampling, at different spatial (intra-reef and inter-reef) and temporal (inter-season and inter-year) scales. Our findings highlight the importance of asexual reproduction in maintaining these populations, and the prevalence of the initial seedling recruitment strategy (ISR), leading to a high stability of clonal composition over seasons and years. It also seemed that clonal propagation was limited to the reef scale (<10km) while reefs were connected by sexual dispersal. This is the first time that clonal structure in sea cucumbers has been studied at such a fine scale, with a specific sampling strategy. It provides key findings on the genetic diversity and structure of fissiparous sea cucumbers, which will be useful for the management of wild populations and aquaculture.

We have reconstructed a molecular phylogeny of 54 Gobiosomatini taxa (65 individuals) based on a 1646-bp region that includes the mitochondrial 12S rRNA, tRNA-Val, and 16S rRNA genes. Our results support the monophyly of the seven-spined gobies and are in agreement with the existence of two major groups within the tribe, the Gobiosoma group and the Microgobius group. However, they reject the monophyly of some of the Gobiosomatini genera. We use the molecular phylogeny to study the dynamics of speciation in the Gobiosomatini by testing for departures from the constant speciation rate model. We observe a burst of speciation in the early evolutionary history of the group and a subsequent slowdown. Our results show a split among clades into coastal-estuarian, deep ocean, and tropical reef habitats. Major habitat shifts account for the early significant acceleration in lineage splitting and speciation rate and the initial divergence of the main Gobiosomatini clades. We found that subsequent diversification is triggered by behavior and niche specializations at least in the reef-associated clades. Overall, our results confirm that the diversity of Gobiosomatini has arisen during episodes of adaptive radiation, and emphasize the importance of ecology in marine speciation.

Evaluating summary statistics used to test for incomplete lineage sorting: mito-nuclear discordance in the reef sponge Callyspongia vaginalis	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						coalescent; Florida keys; Porifera; simulation	GIANT BARREL SPONGE; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; POPULATION-GENETICS; SPERM COMPETITION; BIASED DISPERSAL; SEQUENCES; EVOLUTION; SOFTWARE; POLYMORPHISM; PATTERNS	Conflicting patterns of population differentiation between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes (mito-nuclear discordance) have become increasingly evident as multilocus data sets have become easier to generate. Incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) of nucDNA is often implicated as the cause of such discordance, stemming from the large effective population size of nucDNA relative to mtDNA. However, selection, sex-biased dispersal and historical demography can also lead to mito-nuclear discordance. Here, we compare patterns of genetic diversity and subdivision for six nuclear protein-coding gene regions to those for mtDNA in a common Caribbean coral reef sponge, Callyspongia vaginalis, along the Florida reef tract. We also evaluated a suite of summary statistics to determine which are effective metrics for comparing empirical and simulated data when testing drivers of mito-nuclear discordance in a statistical framework. While earlier work revealed three divergent and geographically subdivided mtDNA COI haplotypes separated by 2.4% sequence divergence, nuclear alleles were admixed with respect to mitochondrial clade and geography. Bayesian analysis showed that substitution rates for the nuclear loci were up to 7 times faster than for mitochondrial COI. Coalescent simulations and neutrality tests suggested that mito-nuclear discordance in C. vaginalis is not the result of ILS in the nucDNA or selection on the mtDNA but is more likely caused by changes in population size. Sperm-mediated gene flow may also influence patterns of population subdivision in the nucDNA.

Effects of geography and life history traits on genetic differentiation in benthic marine fishes	ECOGRAPHY			English	Article							PELAGIC LARVAL DURATION; CORAL-REEF FISHES; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; OCEAN CURRENTS; COMPARATIVE PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; POPULATION-GENETICS; PROPAGULE DISPERSAL; INTERTIDAL BARNACLE; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; BAJA-CALIFORNIA	Dispersal of planktonic larvae can create connections between geographically separated adult populations of benthic marine animals. How geographic context and life history traits affect these connections is largely unresolved. We use data from genetic studies (species level FST) of benthic teleost fishes combined with linear models to evaluate the importance of transitions between biogeographic regions, geographic distance, egg type (benthic or pelagic eggs), pelagic larval duration (PLD), and type of genetic marker as factors affecting differentiation within species. We find that transitions between biogeographic regions and egg type are significant and consistent contributors to population genetic structure, whereas PLD does not significantly explain population structure. Total study distance frequently contributes to significant interaction terms, particularly in association with genetic markers, whereby FST increases with study distance for studies employing mtDNA sequences, but allozyme and microsatellite studies show no increase in FST with study distance. These results highlight the importance of spatial context (biogeography and geographic distance) in affecting genetic differentiation and imply that there are inherent differences in dispersal ability associated with egg type. We also find that the geographic distance over which the maximum pairwise FST between populations occurs (relative to total study distance) is highly variable and can be observed at any scale. This result is consistent with stochastic processes inflating genetic differentiation and/or insufficient consideration of geographic and biological factors relevant to connectivity.

Here, we analyzed data produced by Restriction-Site Associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-Seq) of octocorals in the genus Paramuricea to elucidate diversification patterns and examine the role of environmental gradients in their evolution. The genus Paramuricea evolved around 8 MYA, with a high probability of a broad ancestral depth range from mesophotic depths to the deep sea. At around 1-2 MYA, the genus diversified across the continental slope of the deep North Atlantic, supporting the depth-differentiation hypothesis, with no invasions back into shallower depths (< 200 m). Diversification in the deep sea generally occurred from shallower, warmer waters to deeper, colder depths of the lower continental slope. We also found that the vertical structure of water masses was influential in shaping phylogeographic patterns across the North Atlantic Ocean, with clades found in either upper/intermediate or intermediate/deep water masses. Our data suggest that species diverged first because of environmental conditions, including depth, temperature, and/or water mass, and then diversified into different geographical regions multiple times. Our results highlight the role of the environment in driving the evolution and distribution of Paramuricea throughout the deep sea. Furthermore, our study supports prior work showing the utility of genomic approaches over the conventionally-used DNA barcodes in octocoral species delimitation.

This species is a culturally important food fish in the Mariana Archipelago and subject to high fishing pressure. Our primary hypothesis was to test whether the individuals resident in the southern Mariana Island chain were genetically distinct and hence should be managed as discrete stocks. In addition to spatial sampling of adults, newly-settled individuals were sampled on Guam over four recruitment events to assess the temporal stability of the observed spatial patterns, and evidence of self-recruitment. We found significant genetic structure in S. spinus across the western Pacific, with Bayesian analyses revealing three genetically distinct clusters: the southern Mariana Islands, east Micronesia, and the west Pacific; with the southern Mariana Islands being more strongly differentiated from the rest of the region. Analyses of temporal samples from Guam indicated the southern Mariana cluster was stable over time, with no genetic differentiation between adults versus recruits, or between samples collected across four separate recruitment events spanning 11 months. Subsequent assignment tests indicated seven recruits had self-recruited from within the Southern Mariana Islands population. Our results confirm the relative isolation of the southern Mariana Islands population and highlight how local processes can act to isolate populations that, by virtue of their broad-scale distribution, have been subject to traditionally high gene flows. Our results add to a growing consensus that self-recruitment is a highly significant influence on the population dynamics of tropical reef fish.

The invasive potential of this species has been studied through reproductive biology and population genetics but no study has yet examined the microbial diversity associated with this ascidian and its potential role in host ecology and invasiveness. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene tag pyrosequencing and transmission electron microscopy to characterize the abundance, diversity and host-specificity of bacteria associated with 3 Mediterranean individuals of S. plicata. Microscopy revealed low bacterial abundance in the inner tunic and their absence from gonad tissues, while pyrosequencing revealed a high diversity of S. plicata-associated bacteria (284 OTUs from 16 microbial phyla) in the inner tunic. The core symbiont community was small and consisted of 16 OTUs present in all S. plicata hosts. This core community included a recently described ascidian symbiont (Hasllibacter halocynthiae) and several known sponge and coral symbionts, including a strictly anaerobic Chloroflexi lineage. Most recovered bacterial OTUs (79.6 %) were present in single S. plicata individuals and statistical analyses of genetic diversity and community structure confirmed high variability of bacterial communities among host individuals. These results suggest that diverse and variable bacterial communities inhabit the tunic of S. plicata, including environmental and host-associated bacterial lineages that appear to be re-established each host generation. We hypothesize that bacterial communities in S. plicata are dynamic and have the potential to aid host acclimation to new habitats by establishing relationships with beneficial, locally sourced bacteria.

Phylogeography of a pearl oyster (Pinctada maxima) across the Indo-Australian Archipelago: evidence of strong regional structure and population expansions but no phylogenetic breaks	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						biogeography; Coral Triangle; marine conservation; mtDNA; population genetics	GRADIENT GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA ANALYSIS; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; WEST PACIFIC; JAMESON MOLLUSCA; GIANT CLAM; MALAY-ARCHIPELAGO; EAST-INDIES; SEX-RATIO; PATTERNS	This study investigates the genetic structure and phylogeography of a broadcast spawning bivalve mollusc, Pinctada maxima, throughout the Indo-West Pacific and northern Australia. DNA sequence variation of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was analysed in 367 individuals sampled from nine populations across the Indo-West Pacific. Hierarchical AMOVA indicated strong genetic structuring amongst populations (FST?=?0.372, P?<?0.001); however, sequence divergence between the 47 haplotypes detected was low (maximum 1.8% difference) and no deep phylogenetic divergence was observed. Results suggest the presence of genetic barriers isolating populations of the South China Sea and central Indonesian regions, which, in turn, show patterns of historical separation from northern Australian regions. In P.?maxima, historical vicariance during Pleistocene low sea levels is likely to have restricted planktonic larval transport, causing genetic differentiation amongst populations. However, low genetic differentiation is observed where strong ocean currents are present and is most likely due to contemporary larval transport along these pathways. Geographical association with haplotype distributions may indicate signs of early lineage sorting arising from historical population separations, yet an absence of divergent phylogenetic clades related to geography could be the consequence of periodic pulses of high genetic exchange. We compare our results with previous microsatellite DNA analysis of these P.?maxima populations, and discuss implications for future conservation management of this species.

Distinct patterns of hybridization across a suture zone in a coral reef fish (Dascyllus trimaculatus)	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Dascyllus trimaculatus; hybrid zones; Indo-Pacific; introgression; mitochondrial DNA; phylogeography; RADSeq	POPULATION-GENETICS; INDO-PACIFIC; R-PACKAGE; DAMSELFISH; INTROGRESSION; EVOLUTION; BIOGEOGRAPHY; SPECIATION; SELECTION; IMPACTS	Hybrid zones are natural laboratories for investigating the dynamics of gene flow, reproductive isolation, and speciation. A predominant marine hybrid (or suture) zone encompasses Christmas Island (CHR) and Cocos (Keeling) Islands (CKE), where 15 different instances of interbreeding between closely related species from Indian and Pacific Oceans have been documented. Here, we report a case of hybridization between genetically differentiated Pacific and Indian Ocean lineages of the three-spot dascyllus, Dascyllus trimaculatus (Ruppell, 1829). Field observations indicate there are subtle color differences between Pacific and Indian Ocean lineages. Most importantly, population densities of color morphs and genetic analyses (mitochondrial DNA and SNPs obtained via RADSeq) suggest that the pattern of hybridization within the suture zone is not homogeneous. At CHR, both color morphs were present, mitochondrial haplotypes of both lineages were observed, and SNP analyses revealed both pure and hybrid genotypes. Meanwhile, in CKE, the Indian Ocean color morphs were prevalent, only Indian Ocean mitochondrial haplotypes were observed, and SNP analysis showed hybrid individuals with a large proportion (similar to 80%) of their genotypes assigning to the Indian Ocean lineage. We conclude that CHR populations are currently receiving an influx of individuals from both ocean basins, with a greater influence from the Pacific Ocean. In contrast, geographically isolated CKE populations appear to be self-recruiting and with more influx of individuals from the Indian Ocean. Our research highlights how patterns of hybridization can be different at scales of hundreds of kilometers, due to geographic isolation and the history of interbreeding between lineages.

Vertical and horizontal photobiont transmission within populations of a lichen symbiosis	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Review						algae; ecological genetics; empirical; fungi; Lobaria pulmonaria; microsatellite; population genetics	EPIPHYTIC LICHEN; LOBARIA-PULMONARIA; XANTHORIA-PARIETINA; MOLECULAR EVIDENCE; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; MICROSATELLITE MARKERS; SEXUAL REPRODUCTION; POPULUS-TREMULOIDES; THALLUS DEVELOPMENT; FUNGAL ENDOPHYTES	Lichens are widespread symbioses and play important roles in many terrestrial ecosystems. The genetic structure of lichens is the result of the association between fungal and algal populations constituting the lichen thallus. Using eight fungus- and seven alga-specific highly variable microsatellite markers on within-population spatial genetic data from 62 replicate populations across Europe, North America, Asia and Africa, we investigated the contributions of vertical and horizontal transmission of the photobiont to the genetic structure of the epiphytic lichen Lobaria pulmonaria. Based on pairwise comparisons of multilocus genotypes defined separately for the mycobiont and for the photobiont, we inferred the transmission mode of the photobiont and the relative contribution of somatic mutation and recombination. After constraining the analysis of one symbiont to pairs of individuals with genetically identical symbiotic partners, we found that 77% of fungal and 70% of algal pairs were represented by clones. Thus, the predominant dispersal mode was by means of symbiotic vegetative propagules (vertical transmission), which dispersed fungal and algal clones co-dependently over a short distance, thus shaping the spatial genetic structure up to distances of 20 m. Evidence for somatic mutation generating genetic diversity was found in both symbionts, accounting for 30% of pairwise comparisons in the alga and 15% in the fungus. While the alga did not show statistically significant evidence of recombination, recombination accounted for 7.7% of fungal pairs with identical algae. This implies that, even in a mostly vegetatively reproducing species, horizontal transmission plays a role in shaping the symbiotic association, as shown in many coral and other symbioses in nature.

Seascape genetics along environmental gradients in the Arabian Peninsula: insights from ddRAD sequencing of anemonefishes	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						empirical; fish; hybridization; landscape genetics; population genetics	CORAL-REEF FISHES; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; RED-SEA; SELECTION; GENOTYPE; ECOLOGY; LOCI; DIFFERENTIATION; HYBRIDIZATION; INDIVIDUALS	Understanding the processes that shape patterns of genetic structure across space is a central aim of landscape genetics. However, it remains unclear how geographical features and environmental variables shape gene flow, particularly for marine species in large complex seascapes. Here, we evaluated the genomic composition of the two-band anemonefish Amphiprion bicinctus across its entire geographical range in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, as well as its close relative, Amphiprion omanensis endemic to the southern coast of Oman. Both the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea are complex and environmentally heterogeneous marine systems that provide an ideal scenario to address these questions. Our findings confirm the presence of two genetic clusters previously reported for A. bicinctus in the Red Sea. Genetic structure analyses suggest a complex seascape configuration, with evidence of both isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by environment (IBE). In addition to IBD and IBE, genetic structure among sites was best explained when two barriers to gene flow were also accounted for. One of these coincides with a strong oligotrophic-eutrophic gradient at around 16-20 degrees N in the Red Sea. The other agrees with a historical bathymetric barrier at the straight of Bab al Mandab. Finally, these data support the presence of interspecific hybrids at an intermediate suture zone at Socotra and indicate complex patterns of genomic admixture in the Gulf of Aden with evidence of introgression between species. Our findings highlight the power of recent genomic approaches to resolve subtle patterns of gene flow in marine seascapes.

The Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery method, the Poisson tree processes algorithm and the Generalized mixed Yule-coalescent model have been proposed as means of increasing the rate of biodiversity description using single locus data. We applied these methods to explore the diversity within the Aglaopheniidae, a hydrozoan family with many species widely distributed across tropical and temperate oceans. Our analyses revealed widespread cryptic diversity in this family, almost half of the morpho-species presenting several independent evolutionary lineages, as well as support for cases of synonymy. For two common species of this family, Lytocarpia brevirostris and Macrorhynchia phoenicea, we compared the outputs to clustering analyses based on microsatellite data and to nuclear gene phylogenies. For L. brevirostris, microsatellite data were congruent with results of the species delimitation methods, revealing the existence of two cryptic species with Indo-Pacific distribution. For M.. phoenicea, all analyses confirmed the presence of two cryptic species within the South-Western Indian Ocean. Our study suggests that the diversity of Aglaopheniidae might be much higher than assumed, likely related to low dispersal capacities. Sequence-based species delimitation methods seem highly valuable to reveal cryptic diversity in hydrozoans; their application in an integrative framework will be very useful in describing the phyletic diversity of these organisms.

Significant sex-ratio biases were noted, and these varied among reefs, apparently with latitude, Demographic data suggested that highly discontinuous and localized recruitment occurs. Surveys of allozyme frequencies at 12 loci revealed no significant genetic differences among populations of Trochus niloticus at any geographical scale. High gene flow between zones of the GBR was inferred, with the number of migrants per generation (N-m) of the order of 100. Directional selection was thought to occur at one locus (GDH*). Genetic variability in T. niloticus (H = 0.069 to 0.110, and only three loci polymorphic) was low compared with other trochids. This was thought to be due to smaller effective population size, resulting from an unbalanced sex-ratio, aggregative spatial distribution of adults, high variance in reproductive success, and/or the occurrence of population extinctions and recolonisations. In contrast, Tectus coerulescens exhibited significant genetic differences between zones, indicating a much lower rate of migration between populations (N-m similar to 1 to 10), and displayed high genetic diversity (H = 0.225 to 0.279). A trend for increasing genetic diversity from the northern to southern GBR was found in both species. It is not clear whether the occurrence of two contrasted population genetic structures in species with apparently similar life-histories is due to ecological or historical factors.

Deconstructing an assemblage of "turtle" barnacles: species assignments and fickle fidelity in Chelonibia	MARINE BIOLOGY			English	Article							CORAL-INHABITING BARNACLES; LOGGERHEAD SEA-TURTLES; POPULATION-GENETICS; PATULA RANZANI; LIFE-HISTORY; CIRRIPEDIA; TESTUDINARIA; HOST; BALANOMORPHA; ATTACHMENT	Barnacles in the genus Chelonibia are commensal with a variety of motile marine animals including sea turtles, crustaceans, and sirenians. We conducted a worldwide molecular phylogenetic survey of Chelonibia collected from nearly all known hosts to assess species relationships, host-fidelity, and phylogeographic structure. Using DNA sequences from a protein-coding mitochondrial gene (COI), a mitochondrial rRNA gene (12S), and one nuclear rRNA gene (28S), we found that of four species, three (C. testudinaria, C. patula, and C. manati) are genetically indistinguishable. In addition, we show each utilizes a rare androdioecious mode of reproduction involving complemental males. In contrast, the fourth species (C. caretta), which is hermaphroditic and specializes on turtles, is genetically distinct-leading to the conclusion that the three former taxa are morphotypes of the same species and should be synonymized under C. testudinaria. Phylogenetic analysis resulted in three geographic clades (Atlantic, Indian Ocean/western Pacific, and eastern Pacific) with haplotype parsimony networks revealing no shared haplotypes among geographic regions. Analysis of molecular variance detected significant differences among sequences by region (p < 0.005); conversely, there were no significant differences among sequences when grouped by host or taxonomic designation. Average pairwise genetic distances were lower between the eastern Pacific and Atlantic clades (0.053 +/- A 0.006) than between the eastern Pacific and Indian Ocean/western Pacific clades (0.073 +/- A 0.008), suggesting Atlantic and eastern Pacific populations were connected more recently, perhaps until the rise of the Isthmus of Panama. Host use by Chelonibia morphotypes is discussed along with speculation on possible ancestral hosts and support for a "turtle-first" hypothesis.

The adult benthic populations occupy disjunct, patchy habitats; the extent of gene flow due to dispersal of the planktonic life stage is generally unknown. We investigated dispersal, gene flow, and endemism in eight species of Caribbean reef fishes that varied in two life-history traits that may affect dispersal ability: egg type (pelagic and nonpelagic) and length of planktonic (usually larval) life. Using restriction endonuclease analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), we estimated the degree of genetic differentiation among six populations of each of the eight species; these populations came from widely separated locales, occupying both the northern and southern current tracks within the Caribbean. In addition, we calculated mtDNA divergence between two of the study species and their sister taxa in the eastern Pacific. The transisthmian taxa have been isolated from one another for approximately 3 million yr and thus provide a divergence measure against which to assess intra-Caribbean mtDNA distances. Mean sequence divergence observed among conspecific Caribbean mtDNA haplotypes in each of the eight fish species was small, less than 0.7% for all but one species. This level of divergence is roughly one order of magnitude less than mtDNA divergence between Caribbean/eastern Pacific sister taxa. For each of the eight species of fishes, the predominant mtDNA haplotype was widespread in the Caribbean. Populations located in different major surface currents were no more differentiated from one another than populations occupying the same current track. These results suggest that there is considerable gene flow throughout the Caribbean, and that this gene flow has not been constrained by present-day ocean currents. We found statistically significant population subdivision for three Caribbean fish species, though between-population variance accounted for only 8%-17% of the total. Fishes showing population structure were: Stegastes leucostictus (nonpelagic eggs; short planktonic life); Gnatholepis thompsoni (nonpelagic eggs; long planktonic life); and Halichoeres bivittatus (pelagic eggs; short planktonic life). These results suggest that neither egg type nor length of larval life is a simple predictor of geographic structure in reef fish populations.

A case from a clonal marine organism	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Review							MONTASTRAEA-ANNULARIS; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; GROWTH FORM; REEF CORAL; ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION; SPECIES BOUNDARIES; HYBRID SPECIATION; GENETIC-VARIATION; LARVAL DISPERSAL; CARIBBEAN CORAL	Background: Clonal marine organisms exhibit high levels of morphological variation. Morphological differences may be a response to environmental factors but also they can be attributed to accumulated genetic differences due to disruption of gene flow among populations. In this study, we examined the extensive morphological variation (of 14 characters) in natural populations observed in the gorgonian Eunicea flexuosa, a widely distributed Caribbean octocoral. Eco-phenotypic and genetic effects were evaluated by reciprocal transplants of colonies inhabiting opposite ends of the depth gradient and analysis of population genetics of mitochondrial and nuclear genes, respectively. Results: Significant differences (P < 0.001) in 14 morphological traits were found among colonies inhabiting 12 locations distributed in seven reefs in southwest Puerto Rico. Results from principal component analysis indicated the presence of two groups based on depth distribution, suggesting the presence of two discrete morphotypes (i.e. shallow type < 5 m and deep type > 17 m). A discriminant function analysis based on a priori univariate and multivariate analyses (which separated the colonies in morphotypes) correctly classified 93% of the colonies for each environment. Light, water motion and sediment transport might influence the distribution of the two morphotypes. Reaction norms of morphological characters of colonies reciprocally transplanted showed gradual significant changes through the 15 months of transplantation. Sclerites of shallow water colonies became larger when transplanted to deeper environments and vice versa, but neither of the two transplanted groups overlapped with the residents' morphology. Genetic analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear genes suggested that such discrete morphology and non-overlapping phenotypic plasticity is correlated with the presence of two independent evolutionary lineages. The distribution of the lineages is non-random and may be related to adaptational responses of each lineage to the environmental demands of each habitat. Conclusion: The extensive distribution and ample morphological variation of Eunicea flexuosa corresponds to two distinct genetic lineages with narrower distributions and more rigid phenotypic plasticity than the original description. The accepted description sensu Bayer (1961) of E. flexuosa is a complex of at least two distinct genetic lineages, adapted to different habitats and do not exchange genetic material despite living in sympatry. The present study highlights the importance of correctly defining species, because the unknowingly use of species complexes can overestimate geographical distribution, population abundance, and physiological tolerance.

Most species appear to have evolved as a local radiation and mostly occupy sympatric distributions throughout New Zealand. To investigate the forces driving current gene-flow patterns and past evolutionary histories, we searched for common patterns of population genetic subdivision within eight species sampled throughout their distributions [mitchochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region, n = 1086]. We hypothesised that common phylogeographical and population differentiation patterns would reveal past or ongoing physical processes, with differences reflecting stochastic or species-specific processes. Striking differences between species were apparent, with strong phylogeographical structure detected in Grahamina capito and the estuarine species G. nigripenne. G. capito fell into three distinct geographically restricted lineages. G. nigripenne largely separated into northern and southern lineages (Phi(ST) 0.834). Strong population structuring and isolation by distance was evident in Bellapiscis medius, B. lesleyae and Forsterygion lapillum (Phi(ST) 0.686, 0.436 and 0.115, respectively). High gene flow was apparent in G. gymnota and Ruanoho whero, and F. varium. However, for the latter species, isolation was apparent with samples collected from the offshore Three Kings Islands. Overall, a strong relationship was found between habitat depth and population structure among species, and species inhabiting shallower water habitats showed lower genetic diversity with higher levels of population subdivision. High-latitude populations generally showed low haplotype and nucleotide diversity. These data suggest that processes resulting from intraspecific differences in habitat preference, climatic histories and/or larval ecologies have subdivided populations of shallow water triplefin species.

The Caribbean blue-legged hermit crab (Clibanarius tricolor) is among the species targeted for functional reef tanks, valued for its role as an aquarium cleaner. Little is known about the biology of the species or the genetic landscape in which the increased collecting is happening. Here, we investigate the phylogeographic history and genetic diversity of C. tricolor through analysis of mitochondrial (CO1, 16S) and nuclear (H3) DNA. We test whether phylogeographic breaks for other invertebrates structure the genetic diversity of C. tricolor and explore additional factors that may govern structure, such as reproductive strategy, life history, habitat preference, adult mobility, demographic history, and vicariance events. Based on these three markers, we find high genetic diversity and connectivity and find no evidence to support the tested barriers as relevant to gene flow for C. tricolor. Rather, mitochondrial and nuclear markers infer high genetic diversity, panmixia, and demographic expansion during the Pleistocene. Our finding of panmixia makes it difficult to identify source or sink populations, but the absence of hierarchical structure inferred from mtDNA and nuDNA markers we use, high levels of genetic diversity and homogeneity for these same markers, and advantageous life history traits suggest C. tricolor is not currently at special risk; however, geographically restricted haplotypes and limitations within our study prevent us from making a strong conclusion about the sustainability of the fishery. Our work on the Caribbean blue-legged hermit crab highlights the importance of acquiring basic information on exploited species and reiterates that common regional forces may not equally impact connectivity among co-distributed species.

The genus Stegastes is composed of nearly 33 species, and 8 are endemic to the Brazilian Province, inhabiting the Brazilian coast (Stegastes fuscus, S. variabilis, S. leucosticus, S. uenfi, and S. pictus) or Western Atlantic oceanic islands (S. trindadensis, S. rocasensis and S. sanctipauli). Stegastes species play a major role in the reef ecosystem since they interfere significantly with the composition of benthonic organisms. Studies about population genetics and speciation of Neotropical ichthyofauna are scarce, particularly at insular areas from the Western Atlantic. Random amplified polymorphic DNA markers were used to analyze the population genetic structure of the continental species S. fuscus and S. variabilis (Northeastern Brazil) as well as the insular species S. sanctipauli (Saint Paul's Rocks). Analysis of population parameters revealed a high index of intrapopulation genetic variability in the species, except for S. sanctipauli, which showed low values. The phi(ST) values in samples of S. fuscus and S. variabilis obtained at distinct collection sites 35 km apart from each other indicated a lack of population genetic structure. An intermediary profile of species-specific markers was detected in some individuals of S. fuscus and S. variabilis from Santa Rita, Rio Grande do Norte, suggesting a putative introgression event between the two species. The genetic profiles observed in Stegastes populations indicate a higher genetic variability along the shoreline than at oceanic sites, related to a reduced effective population size on islands. The lack of genetic differentiation among coastal populations suggests that, despite some biological features such as non-migratory behavior and territoriality, the pelagic larval phase of these species is able to promote an interpopulation homogeneity among sampled areas.

A total of 316 individuals from the three species, and an additional eight and six individuals of P. argentata and P. pawak were employed in this study. Two genetically divergent lineages each of P. argentata and P. anea (lineages L1 and L2) were respectively detected from the analyses based on mitochondrial cytochrome b gene data. Historical biogeography analysis with a multi-gene dataset revealed that Pennahia species most likely originated in the South China Sea and expanded into the eastern Indian Ocean, East China Sea, and northwestern Pacific Ocean through three separate range expansions. The main diversifications of Pennahia species occurred during Miocene and Pliocene periods, and the occurrences of lineage divergences within P. anea and P. argentata were during the Pleistocene, likely as a consequence of cyclical glaciations. The population expansions that occurred after the sea level rise might be the reason for the population homogeneity observed in P. macrocephalus and most P. anea L2 South China Sea populations. The structure observed between the two populations of P. ovata, and the restricted distributions of P. anea lineage L1 and P. ovata in the eastern Indian Ocean, might have been hampered by the northward flowing ocean current at the Malacca Strait and by the distribution of coral reefs or rocky bottoms. While our results support S. Ekman's center-of-origin hypothesis taking place in the South China Sea, the Malacca Strait serving as the center of overlap is a supplementary postulation for explaining the present-day high diversity of pennah croakers centered in these waters.

Phylogeography of the olive sea snake, Aipysurus laevis (Hydrophiinae) indicates Pleistocene range expansion around northern Australia but low contemporary gene flow	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						Aipysurus; mitochondrial DNA; phylogeography; Pleistocene; population genetics; sea snake	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; INDO-WEST PACIFIC; STARFISH ACANTHASTER-PLANCI; HIGH-DISPERSAL STARFISH; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE; STATISTICAL TESTS; PENAEUS-MONODON; MARINE TURTLES	Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations profoundly changed landmass configurations around northern Australia. The cyclic emergence of the Torres Strait land bridge and concomitant shifts in the distribution of shallow-water marine habitats repeatedly sundered east and west coast populations. These biogeographical perturbations invoke three possible scenarios regarding the directions of interglacial range expansion: west to east, east to west, or bidirectional. We evaluated these scenarios for the olive sea snake, Aipysurus laevis, by exploring its genetic structure around northern Australia based on 354 individuals from 14 locations in three regions (Western Australia, WA; Gulf of Carpentaria, GoC; Great Barrier Reef, GBR). A 726-bp fragment of the mitochondrial DNA ND4 region revealed 41 variable sites and 38 haplotypes, with no shared haplotypes among the three regions. Population genetic structure was strong overall, phi(ST) = 0.78, P < 0.001, and coalescent analyses revealed no migration between regions. Genetic diversity was low in the GBR and GoC and the genetic signatures of these regions indicated range or population expansions consistent with their recent marine transgressions around 7000 years ago. By contrast, genetic diversity on most WA reefs was higher and there were no signals of recent expansion events on these reefs. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that GBR and GoC haplotypes were derived from WA haplotypes; however, statistical parsimony suggested that recent range expansion in the GBR-GoC probably occurred from east coast populations, possibly in the Coral Sea. Levels of contemporary female-mediated gene flow varied within regions and reflected potential connectivity among populations afforded by the different regional habitat types.

However, geographically widespread and phenotypically uniform species also do occur within Gobiosomatini. This lack of phenotypic variation across large geographic areas could be due to recent colonization, widespread gene flow, or stabilizing selection acting across environmental gradients. We use a phylogeographic approach to test these alternative hypotheses in the naked goby Gobiosomabosc, a widespread and phenotypically invariable intertidal fish found along the Atlantic Coast of North America. Using DNA sequence from 218 individuals sampled at 15 localities, we document marked intraspecific genetic structure in mitochondrial and nuclear genes at three main geographic scales: (i) between Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Coast, (ii) between the west coast of the Florida peninsula and adjacent Gulf of Mexico across the Apalachicola Bay, and (iii) at local scales of a few hundred kilometers. Clades on either side of Florida diverged about 8 million years ago, whereas some populations along the East Cost show divergent phylogroups that have differentiated within the last 200,000 years. The absence of noticeable phenotypic or ecological differentiation among lineages suggests the role of stabilizing selection on ancestral phenotypes, together with isolation in allopatry due to reduced dispersal and restricted gene flow, as the most likely explanation for their divergence. Haplotype phylogenies and spatial patterns of genetic diversity reveal frequent population bottlenecks followed by rapid population growth, particularly along the Gulf of Mexico. The magnitude of the genetic divergence among intraspecific lineages suggests the existence of cryptic species within Gobiosoma and indicates that modes of speciation can vary among lineages within Gobiidae.

The fine-scale interactions between individual genotypes of host and symbiont remain largely unstudied and constitute a major gap in knowledge. By applying microsatellite markers developed for both host and symbiont, we investigated the intracolony diversity, prevalence and stability of Symbiodinium glynni (type D1) multilocus genotypes in association with dense populations of Pocillopora at two sites in the Gulf of California. The genetic diversity and allelic frequencies in reef populations of S.similar to glynni remained stable over 3 years. Common clone genotypes persisted over this period, and no temporal population subdivision (FPT = 0.021 and -0.003) was detected. Collections from circular plots showed no statistical correlation between related Pocillopora individuals and their associations with particular S.similar to glynni genotypes, with no spatial structuring or clonal aggregation across a reef for the symbiont. From permanent linear transects, samples were analysed from multiple locations within a colony and some were resampled approximately 1 year later. Many of these multisampled colonies (approximately 53%) were dominated by a single S.similar to glynni genotype and tended to associate with the same symbiont genotype(s) over time, while colony ramets often possessed unrelated symbiont genotypes. In contrast to the species level, associations between genotypes of Pocillopora and S.similar to glynni are apparently more flexible over space and time. The abundance of sexually recombinant genotypes of S.similar to glynni combined with greater flexibility might provide adaptive mechanisms for these symbioses to evolve rapidly to changes in environmental conditions and allow particular symbiont genotypes to spread through a host population.

Genetic diversity is an important determinant of population fitness and resilience, and can require careful management to ensure sufficient variation is present. In addition, population genetics data reveal patterns of connectivity and gene flow between locations, enabling mangers to predict recovery and resilience, identify areas of local adaptation, and generate restoration plans. Here, we demonstrate a conservation genetics approach to inform restoration and management of the loggerhead sponge (Spheciospongia vesparium) in the Florida Keys, USA. This species is a dominant, habitat-forming component of marine ecosystems in the Caribbean region, but in Florida has suffered numerous mass mortality events. We developed microsatellite markers and used them to genotype sponges from 14 locations in Florida and a site each in The Bahamas, Belize and Barbuda. We found that genetic diversity levels were similar across all sites, but inbreeding and bottleneck signatures were present in Florida. Populations are highly structured at the regional scale, whilst within Florida connectivity is present in a weak isolation by distance pattern, coupled with chaotic genetic patchiness. Evidence of a weak barrier to gene flow was found in Florida among sites situated on opposite sides of the islands in the Middle Keys. Loggerhead sponge populations in Florida are vulnerable in the face of mass mortalities due to low connectivity with other areas in the region, as well as distance-limited and unpredictable local connectivity patterns. However, our discovery of Florida's high genetic diversity increases hope for resilience to future perturbations. These results provide valuable insight for sponge restoration practice in Florida.

Characterizing and comparing the genetic structures of codistributed species, such as host-parasite associations, allow discriminating the relative importance of environmental factors and life history traits that influenced gene flow and demographic events. Using microsatellite and Cytochrome Oxidase I markers, we investigated if a host-parasite pair (the heart urchin Meoma ventricosa and its parasitic pea crab Dissodactylus primitivus) exhibits comparable population genetic structures in the Caribbean Sea and how the observed patterns match connectivity regions from predictive models and other taxa. Highly contrasting patterns were found: the host showed genetic homogeneity across the whole studied area, whereas the parasite displayed significant differentiation at regional and local scales. The genetic diversity of the parasitic crabs (both in microsatellites and COI) was distributed in two main groups, Panama-Jamaica-St Croix on the one hand, and the South-Eastern Caribbean on the other. At a smaller geographical scale, Panamanian and Jamaican parasite populations were genetically more similar, while more genetic differentiation was found within the Lesser Antilles. Both species showed a signature of population expansion during the Quaternary. Some results match predictive models or data from previous studies (e.g., the Western-Eastern dichotomy in the parasite) while others do not (e.g., genetic differentiation within the Lesser Antilles). The sharp dissimilarity of genetic structure of these codistributed species outlines the importance of population expansion events and/or contrasted patterns of gene flow. This might be linked to differences in several life history traits such as fecundity (higher for the host), swimming capacity of larval stages (higher for the parasite), and habitat availability (higher for the host).

Pleistocene isolation and recent gene flow in Haliotis asinina, an Indo-Pacific vetigastropod with limited dispersal capacity	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						abalone; Indo-Malay Archipelagoes; Indo-Pacific; larval dispersal; marine phylogeography; nested clade analysis	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; TROPICAL ABALONE; GEOGRAPHICAL-DISTRIBUTION; BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS; CLADISTIC-ANALYSIS; TIGER PRAWN; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS	Haliotis asinina is a broadcast-spawning mollusc that inhabits Indo-Pacific coral reefs. This tropical abalone develops through a nonfeeding larval stage that is competent to settle on specific species of coralline algae after 3-4 days in the plankton. Failure to contact an inductive algae within 10 days of hatching usually results in death. These life cycle characteristics suggest a limited capacity for dispersal and thus gene flow. This makes H. asinina particularly suitable for elucidating phylogeographical structure throughout the Indo-Malay Archipelagoes, and eastern Indian and western Pacific Oceans, all regions of biogeographical complexity and high conservation value. We assayed 482 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase II gene in 206 abalone collected from 16 geographically discrete sites across the Indian and Pacific Oceans and Indo-Malay Archipelagoes. DNA sequence variation was analysed via population genetics and phylogenetics, and by nested clade analyses (NCA). Our data resolved clear phylogeographical breaks among major biogeographical regions, with sequence divergences ranging from a high of 3.7% and 3.0% between Indian and Pacific sites and Pacific and Indo-Malay sites, respectively, to a low of 1.1% between Indian and Indo-Malay sites. Despite the apparent limited dispersal capacity of H. asinina, no finer scale phylogeographical structure was resolved within the respective biogeographical regions. However, amova and NCA identified several significant associations between haplotypes and geographical distribution, most notably higher gene flow among geographical populations associated with major ocean currents. Our study provides further evidence that larval dispersal capacity alone is not a good predictor of population genetic structure in marine invertebrates. We infer instead that a combination of historical events (long-term barriers followed by range expansion associated with Pleistocene sea level changes) and contemporary processes (gene flow restricted by life history and oceanography) have shaped observed patterns of H. asinina phylogeography.

In 2018, a semi-population outbreak of crown-of-thorns sea star, Acanthaster cf. solaris, was observed on a relatively isolated oceanic island, Ogasawara. The aim of this study was to assess whether this population outbreak was caused by large-scale larval recruitment (termed secondary outbreak) from the Kuroshio region. We estimated larval dispersal of the coral predator A. cf. solaris between the Kuroshio and Ogasawara regions using both population genomic analysis and simulation of oceanographic dispersal. Population genomic analysis revealed overall genetically homogenized patterns among Ogasawara and other Japanese populations, suggesting that the origin of the populations in the two regions is the same. In contrast, a simulation of 26-year oceanographic dispersal indicated that larvae are mostly self-seeded in Ogasawara populations and have difficulty reaching Ogasawara from the Kuroshio region within one generation. However, a connectivity matrix produced by the larval dispersal simulation assuming a Markov chain indicated gradual larval dispersal migration from the Kuroshio region to Ogasawara in a stepping-stone manner over multiple years. These results suggest that the 2018 outbreak was likely the result of self-seeding, including possible inbreeding (as evidenced by clonemate analysis), as large-scale larval dispersal from the Kurishio population to the Ogasawara population within one generation is unlikely. Instead, the population in Ogasawara is basically sustained by self-seedings, and the outbreak in 2018 was also most likely caused by successful self-seedings including possible inbreeding, as evidenced by clonemate analysis. This study also highlighted the importance of using both genomic and oceanographic methods to estimate larval dispersal, which provides significant insight into larval dispersal that occurs on ecological and evolutionary timescales.

Does mating behaviour affect connectivity in marine fishes? Comparative population genetics of two protogynous groupers (Family Serranidae)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						gene flow; groupers; pelagic larval duration; protogyny; reproductive behaviour	CORAL-REEF FISH; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; RED HIND GROUPER; EPINEPHELUS-GUTTATUS; SPAWNING AGGREGATION; LARVAL DURATION; PUERTO-RICO; PATTERNS; SNAPPER; FLOW	Pelagic larval duration (PLD) has been hypothesized to be the primary predictor of connectivity in marine fishes; however, few studies have examined the effects that adult reproductive behaviour may have on realized dispersal. We assessed gene flow (connectivity) by documenting variation in microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA sequences in two protogynous species of groupers, the aggregate spawning red hind, Epinephelus guttatus, and the single-male, harem-spawning coney, Cephalopholis fulva, to ask whether reproductive strategy affects connectivity. Samples of both species were obtained from waters off three islands (Puerto Rico, St. Thomas and St. Croix) in the Caribbean Sea. Despite the notion that aggregate spawning of red hind may facilitate larval retention, stronger signals of population structure were detected in the harem-spawning coney. Heterogeneity and/or inferred barriers, based on microsatellites, involved St. Croix (red hind and coney) and the west coast of Puerto Rico (coney). Heterogeneity and/or inferred barriers, based on mitochondrial DNA, involved St. Croix (coney only). Genetic divergence in both species was stronger for microsatellites than for mitochondrial DNA, suggesting sex-biased dispersal in both species. Long-term migration rates, based on microsatellites, indicated asymmetric gene flow for both species in the same direction as mean surface currents in the region. Red hind had higher levels of variation in microsatellites and lower levels of variation in mitochondrial DNA. Long-term effective size and effective number of breeders were greater for red hind; estimates of ?f, a proxy for long-term effective female size, were the same in both species. Patterns of gene flow in both species appear to stem in part from shared aspects of larval and adult biology, local bathymetry and surface current patterns. Differences in connectivity and levels of genetic variation between the species, however, likely stem from differences in behaviour related to reproductive strategy.	[Portnoy, D. S.; Hollenbeck, C.

J	van Herwerden, L; Benzie, J; Davies, C				van Herwerden, L; Benzie, J; Davies, C			Microsatellite variation and population genetic structure of the red throat emperor on the Great Barrier Reef	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY			English	Article						demographic differences; Great Barrier Reef; Lethrinus miniatus; microsatellites; population genetics; stock structure	CORAL TROUT; LETHRINUS-MINIATUS; FLOW; MANAGEMENT; DISTANCES; EVOLUTION; PISCES; FISH; DNA	Analysis (using three analytical approaches) of eight microsatellite markers from six locations in three geographic regions of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), including populations that differed in demographic characteristics, showed no evidence of genetic stock structure in the red throat emperor Lethrinus miniatus. Measures of inter-population differentiation were nonsignificant (P greater than or equal to 0.67). Using a Bayesian clustering approach, 'admixture' was detected (mean alpha values >1) with allele frequencies for each of the locations sampled being correlated equally with allele frequencies from all locations sampled. The number of populations (K) identified was one, based on the estimates of the probability of the data at various K values (K = 1, 2, 3, . . . 6). Additionally, alpha values did not stabilize to relatively constant values in any of the Bayesian analyses performed, indicating that there was no real genetic structure between locations. Analysis of genetic variation as detected by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that almost all of the variance in the data (99.74%, P less than or equal to 0.023) was within populations, rather than among populations (0.15%, P less than or equal to 0.176) or amongst regions sampled (0.10%, P less than or equal to 0.247) on the GBR. F-st statistics identified four individual loci having statistically significant differentiation among populations, but these were only related to one out of 12 pair-wise comparisons where populations differed demographically. Given these results (albeit using neutral markers), together with the capacity of adults and larvae to be mobile between reefs on the inter-connected GBR, it is considered unlikely that L. miniatus populations exist as distinct genetic stocks in the GBR. It is therefore not possible. using neutral markers, to reject the null hypothesis that the fishery be managed as a single panmictic stock. (C) 2003 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

The main aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic structure, connectivity and demographic history of the longnosed skate in Sardinia (western Mediterranean Sea). Patterns of population structure were assessed in 175 specimens from six sampling sites. Variation in two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and control region) highlighted high genetic diversity and low but significant genetic differentiation among sites, which clustered into three groups corresponding to the north-west, north-east and south Sardinian coasts. The observed genetic structuring could presumably depend on a combination of past geological events, contemporary restrictions to dispersal and biological characteristics of the species (e.g. site-fidelity, no pelagic larval stage, limited dispersal of juveniles and/or adults). Demographic analyses showed signs of past population expansion, but substantial current stability of Sardinian populations. From a conservation perspective, these results are encouraging, and indicate that Sardinian populations are still large and stable, and seem not to have suffered negative side-effects from the ever-growing fishing pressure in the region. The occurrence of genetic structuring strongly supported the close monitoring of populations to identify any erosion of their gene pool, and high genetic variability of the Sardinian D. oxyrinchus populations could thus represent priority populations for conservation purposes, providing potential sources for recolonization in cases of local extinctions in other areas of the distribution range of the species. When the sequences from Sardinia were compared with those available from other areas, the data seem to exclude the possibility that the Atlantic and Mediterranean host totally isolated populations or even different species, as recently suggested. However, additional markers and a larger sampling sites are needed to confirm these findings.

Genetic structure of the Caribbean giant barrel sponge Xestospongia muta using the I3-M11 partition of COI	CORAL REEFS			English	Article						Sponge; Xestospongia muta; Population genetics; Genetic structure; mtDNA; Ocean currents	POLYMORPHIC MICROSATELLITE LOCI; CRAMBE-CRAMBE PORIFERA; OXIDASE SUBUNIT-I; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; CRYPTIC SPECIATION; MARINE SPONGES; MITOCHONDRIAL; REEF; DEMOSPONGIAE; PHYLOGENIES	In recent years, reports of sponge bleaching, disease, and subsequent mortality have increased alarmingly. Population recovery may depend strongly on colonization capabilities of the affected species. The giant barrel sponge Xestospongia muta is a dominant reef constituent in the Caribbean. However, little is known about its population structure and gene flow. The 5'-end fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit I is often used to address these kinds of questions, but it presents very low intraspecific nucleotide variability in sponges. In this study, the usefulness of the I3-M11 partition of COI to determine the genetic structure of X. muta was tested for seven populations from Florida, the Bahamas and Belize. A total of 116 sequences of 544 bp were obtained for the I3-M11 partition corresponding to four haplotypes. In order to make a comparison with the 5'-end partition, 10 sequences per haplotype were analyzed for this fragment. The 40 resulting sequences were of 569 bp and corresponded to two haplotypes. The nucleotide diversity of the I3-M11 partition (pi = 0.00386) was higher than that of the 5'-end partition (pi = 0.00058), indicating better resolution at the intraspecific level. Sponges with the most divergent external morphologies (smooth vs. digitate surface) had different haplotypes, while those with the most common external morphology (rough surface) presented a mixture of haplotypes. Pairwise tests for genetic differentiation among geographic locations based on F (ST) values showed significant genetic divergence between most populations, but this genetic differentiation was not due to isolation by distance. While limited larval dispersal may have led to differentiation among some of the populations, the patterns of genetic structure appear to be most strongly related to patterns of ocean currents. Therefore, hydrological features may play a major role in sponge colonization and need to be considered in future plans for management and conservation of these important components of coral reef ecosystems.

Reevaluating species number, distribution and endemism of the coral genus Pocillopora Lamarck, 1816 using species delimitation methods and microsatellites	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Microsatellites; ORF; Scleractinian; ABGD; GMYC; PTP	HAPLOTYPE RECONSTRUCTION; POPULATION-GENETICS; REEF; MITOCHONDRIAL; SCLERACTINIA; EVOLUTION; CNIDARIA; HYBRIDIZATION; BOUNDARIES; DIVERSITY	Species delimitation methods based on genetic information, notably using single locus data, have been proposed as means of increasing the rate of biodiversity description, but can also be used to clarify complex taxonomies. In this study, we explore the species diversity within the cnidarian genus Pocillopora, widely distributed in the tropical belt of the Indo-Pacific Ocean. From 943 Pocillopora colonies sampled in the Western Indian Ocean, the Tropical Southwestern Pacific and Southeast Polynesia, representing a huge variety of morphotypes, we delineated Primary Species Hypotheses (PSH) applying the Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery method, the Poisson Tree Processes algorithm and the Generalized mixed Yule-coalescent model on two mitochondrial markers (Open Reading Frame and Dloop) and reconstructing a haploweb using one nuclear marker (Internal Transcribed Spacer 2). Then, we confronted identified PSHs to the results of clustering analyses using 13 microsatellites to determine Secondary Species Hypotheses (SSH). Based on the congruence of all methods used and adding sequences from the literature, we defined at least 18 Secondary Species Hypotheses among 14 morphotypes, confirming the high phenotypic plasticity in Pocillopora species and the presence of cryptic lineages. We also identified three new genetic lineages never found to date, which could represent three new putative species. Moreover, the biogeographical ranges of several SSHs were re-assessed in the light of genetic data, which may have direct implications in conservation policies. Indeed, the cryptic diversity within this genus should be taken into account seriously, as neglecting its importance is source of confusion in our understanding of ecosystem functioning. Next generation sequencing, combined with other parameters (i.e. microstructure, zooxanthellae identification, ecology even at a micro-scale, resistance and resilience ability to bleaching) will be the next step towards an integrative framework of Pocillopora taxonomy, which will have profound implications for ecological studies, such as studying biodiversity, response to global warming and symbiosis.

In the Mediterranean Sea, Petrosia ficiformis is one of the species most affected by temperature-related diseases. Our study aimed to assess its genetic structure, connectivity, and bottleneck signatures to understand its evolutionary history and to provide information to help design conservation strategies of sessile marine invertebrates.ResultsWe genotyped 280 individuals from 19 locations across the entire distribution range of P. ficiformis in the Atlanto-Mediterranean region at 10 microsatellite loci. High levels of inbreeding were detected in most locations (especially in the Macaronesia and the Western Mediterranean) and bottleneck signatures were only detected in Mediterranean populations, although not coinciding entirely with those with reported die-offs. We detected strong significant population differentiation, with the Atlantic populations being the most genetically isolated, and show that six clusters explained the genetic structure along the distribution range of this sponge. Although we detected a pattern of isolation by distance in P. ficiformis when all locations were analyzed together, stratified Mantel tests revealed that other factors could be playing a more prominent role than isolation by distance. Indeed, we detected a strong effect of oceanographic barriers impeding the gene flow among certain areas, the strongest one being the Almeria-Oran front, hampering gene flow between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Finally, migration and genetic diversity distribution analyses suggest a Mediterranean origin for the species.ConclusionsIn our study Petrosia ficiformis showed extreme levels of inbreeding and population differentiation, which could all be linked to the poor swimming abilities of the larva. However, the observed moderate migration patterns are highly difficult to reconcile with such poor larval dispersal, and suggest that, although unlikely, dispersal may also be achieved in the gamete phase. Overall, because of the high genetic diversity in the Eastern Mediterranean and frequent mass mortalities in the Western Mediterranean, we suggest that conservation efforts should be carried out specifically in those areas of the Mediterranean to safeguard the genetic diversity of the species.

The present study investigated genetic diversity and gene flow in turtle grass collected at 18, sites in the lower Florida Keys. Fourteen allozyme loci were resolved, of which 5 (ADH-2, GPI, LAP, 6-PDGH, and PGM-2) were variable. The mean heterozygosity for the 18 turtle grass sites was 0.027. The majority of genetic diversity measured occurred within populations, with a small proportion of genetic diversity measured among populations (G(ST) = 0.050). The number of migrants each generation ((N) over bar(m)), an estimate of gene flow, was calculated using Wright's F-statistics. The F-statistics yielded an N-m = 24.8 for sites within the same area, N-m =3.9 for adjacent sites (within 4 km), and an N-m = 1.0 among all 18 collection sites. These results indicated strong gene flow for sites that were adjacent, but not at a distance > 4 km. Three Mantel tests were performed using a genetic distance matrix and three different geographic matrices to test which model of gene flow (isolation by distance, stepping stone, or island model) was appropriate for turtle grass. A stepping stone model closely predicted (p = 0.0015) turtle grass gene flow; physical adjacency (stepping stone model) had a greater effect than geographic distance. Turtle grass sampled on two coral reef sites had significantly different allele frequencies at the PLDH-2 locus from turtle grass on sites in the mangroves. The majority of other studies dealing with seagrass species have found little-to-no genetic variation; however, the present study has documented genetic variation in turtle grass at five allozyme loci. This variation suggests that sexual reproduction map significantly contribute to T. testudinum's genetic structure and evolution. However, overall genetic diversity was relatively low across all sites, indicating a trend towards genetic uniformity of turtle grass in the lower Florida Keys. This genetic uniformity may have contributed to the large turtle grass die-offs in recent years. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Alongside their mineral wealth, SMS deposits also have considerable biological value. Active SMS deposits host endemic hydrothermal vent communities, whilst inactive deposits support communities of deep water corals and other suspension feeders. Mining activities are expected to remove all large organisms and suitable habitat in the immediate area, making vent endemic organisms particularly at risk from habitat loss and localised extinction. As part of environmental management strategies designed to mitigate the effects of mining, areas of seabed need to be protected to preserve biodiversity that is lost at the mine site and to preserve communities that support connectivity among populations of vent animals in the surrounding region. These "set-aside" areas need to be biologically similar to the mine site and be suitably connected, mostly by transport of larvae, to neighbouring sites to ensure exchange of genetic material among remaining populations. Establishing suitable set-asides can be a formidable task for environmental managers, however the application of genetic approaches can aid set-aside identification, suitability assessment and monitoring. There are many genetic tools available, including analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences (e.g. COI or other suitable mtDNA genes) and appropriate nuclear DNA markers (e.g. microsatellites, single nucleotide polymorphisms), environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques and microbial metagenomics. When used in concert with traditional biological survey techniques, these tools can help to identify species, assess the genetic connectivity among populations and assess the diversity of communities. How these techniques can be applied to set-aside decision making is discussed and recommendations are made for the genetic characteristics of set-aside sites. A checklist for environmental regulators forms a guide to aid decision making on the suitability of set-aside design and assessment using genetic tools.

Comparative phylogeography of three host sea anemones in the Indo-Pacific	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Actiniaria; biogeography; Cnidaria; connectivity; coral reef; gene flow; Indo-Pacific; microsatellites; phylogeography; population genetics	GENETIC POPULATION-STRUCTURE; ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION; ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS; ENTACMAEA-QUADRICOLOR; HETERACTIS-MAGNIFICA; F-STATISTICS; REEF FISH; CONNECTIVITY; EVOLUTION; SOFTWARE	Aim The mutualistic relationship between anemones and anemonefishes is one of the most iconic examples of symbiosis. However, while anemonefishes have been extensively studied in terms of genetic connectivity, such information is lacking entirely for host sea anemones. Here, we provide the first information on the broad-scale population structure and phylogeographical patterns of three species of host sea anemone, Heteractis magnifica, Stichodactyla mertensii and Entacmaea quadricolor. We evaluate if there is concordance in genetic structure across several distinct biogeographical areas within the Indo-Pacific region and to what extent the observed patterns may concur with those found for anemonefishes. Location Indo-Pacific, including the Red Sea. Taxon Heteractis magnifica, S. mertensii and E. quadricolor Methods Microsatellite markers and a combination of statistical methods including Bayesian clustering, isolation by distance (IBD), analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and principal components analysis (PCA) were used to determine population structure. The congruence among distance matrices (CADM) method was used to assess similarity in spatial genetic patterns among species. Results Significant population structure was identified in the three host anemone species. Each species is likely composed of at least two genetic clusters corresponding to two biogeographical regions, the Red Sea and the rest of the Indo-Pacific. Two of the three anemone species seem to be experiencing admixture where the two main clusters overlap (the Maldives). IBD analyses in the Red Sea revealed differences in gene flow among species, suggesting more limited dispersal potential for E. quadricolor than for S. mertensii and H. magnifica. Clonality is documented in S. mertensii for the first time. Main conclusions This research documents the genetic population structure for three ecologically important host sea anemones across the Indo-Pacific and provides valuable insights regarding their biogeography and evolution. Specifically, we found high levels of genetic divergence between populations across different biogeographical regions, suggesting different evolutionary lineages within species. At the same time, common geographical overlap of population structures suggests similar evolutionary histories among all three species. Interestingly, the observed patterns are congruent to some extent with structure reported for several anemonefish species, reflecting their close ecological association.

Phylogeography of the littoral prawn species Palaemon elegans (Crustacea: Caridea: Palaemonidae) across the Mediterranean Sea unveils disparate patterns of population genetic structure and demographic history in the two sympatric genetic types II and III	MARINE BIODIVERSITY			English	Article						Population genetics; Phylogeographic break; Larval dispersal; Marine gene flow; North Africa; Eastern Mediterranean Basin	MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA VARIATION; CORAL-REEF FISH; NORTHEAST ATLANTIC; LIFE-HISTORY; GREEN CRAB; MARINE; FLOW; DIFFERENTIATION; CIRCULATION; DISTANCE	In this study, we examine the spatial distribution of genetic diversity of the littoral prawn species complex Palaemon elegans across the Mediterranean, with an emphasis in the eastern Mediterranean, and compare patterns of phylogeographic structure between the two genetic types II and III across potential gene flow barriers. For this purpose, a total of 293 mtDNA sequences of the cytochrome oxidase subunit-1 (Cox1) gene, including a newly generated dataset of 114 sequences, were obtained from 32 Mediterranean locations. The retrieved differences in genealogy and biogeographic patterns between both genetic types, as revealed by the outcome of a TCS statistical parsimony procedure, suggest different colonisation patterns in type II and type III within the Mediterranean. Furthermore, particular gradual transitions of both genetic types were unveiled across different geographic scales. Our results showed not only a marked latitudinal cline in the southeastern Mediterranean, but also a remarkable transition of the proportion of both types along the relatively small scale of the Italian coast. Detailed population genetic investigations and phylogeographic examinations within each genetic type datasets of P. elegans revealed evident and contrasting patterns of genetic structure in type II and type III. While the one-level analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) resulted in significant genetic differentiation for both examined datasets, the outcome of multidimensional scaling (MDS), PERMUT, spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA) and two level-AMOVA analyses showed an obvious lack of phylogeographic structure within type II, versus significant population structuring within type III across known gene flow barriers in the Mediterranean. Notably, the outcome of isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by environment (IBE) analyses within the type III dataset showed that both geographic and environmental distances were significant predictors of genetic distances. The remarkable difference in biogeographic patterns and demographic history [revealed mainly by Bayesian skyline plots (BSP) analysis] between both types suggests the likely involvement of different processes, including larval behaviour and/or residual effects of different phases of evolutionary history in the Mediterranean Sea.

Population genetics at three spatial scales of a rare sponge living in fragmented habitats	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article							MICROSATELLITE LOCI; MARINE-INVERTEBRATES; GENOTYPIC DIVERSITY; MOLECULAR MARKERS; LIFE-HISTORY; CORAL; SEA; DIFFERENTIATION; DISPERSAL; LARVAE	Background: Rare species have seldom been studied in marine habitats, mainly because it is difficult to formally assess the status of rare species, especially in patchy benthic organisms, for which samplings are often assumed to be incomplete and, thus, inappropriate for establishing the real abundance of the species. However, many marine benthic invertebrates can be considered rare, due to the fragmentation and rarity of suitable habitats. Consequently, studies on the genetic connectivity of rare species in fragmented habitats are basic for assessing their risk of extinction, especially in the context of increased habitat fragmentation by human activities. Sponges are suitable models for studying the intra- and inter-population genetic variation of rare invertebrates, as they produce lecitotrophic larvae and are often found in fragmented habitats. Results: We investigated the genetic structure of a Mediterranean sponge, Scopalina lophyropoda (Schmidt), using the allelic size variation of seven specific microsatellite loci. The species can be classified as "rare" because of its strict habitat requirements, the low number of individuals per population, and the relatively small size of its distribution range. It also presents a strong patchy distribution, philopatric larval dispersal, and both sexual and asexual reproduction. Classical genetic-variance-based methods (AMOVA) and differentiation statistics revealed that the genetic diversity of S. lophyropoda was structured at the three spatial scales studied: within populations, between populations of a geographic region, and between isolated geographic regions, although some stochastic gene flow might occur among populations within a region. The genetic structure followed an isolation-by-distance pattern according to the Mantel test. However, despite philopatric larval dispersal and fission events in the species, no single population showed inbreeding, and the contribution of clonality to the population makeup was minor (only ca. 4%). Conclusions: The structure of the S. lophyropoda populations at all spatial scales examined confirms the philopatric larval dispersal that has been reported. Asexual reproduction does not seem to play a relevant role in the populations. The heterozygote excess and the lack of inbreeding could be interpreted as a hitherto unknown outcrossing strategy of the species. The envisaged causes for this strategy are sperm dispersal, a strong selection against the mating of genetically related individuals to avoid inbreeding depression or high longevity of genets combined with stochastic recruitment events by larvae from other populations. It should be investigated whether this strategy could also explain the genetic diversity of many other patchy marine invertebrates whose populations remain healthy over time, despite their apparent rarity.

J	Benzie, JAH; Williams, ST				Benzie, JAH; Williams, ST			Genetic structure of giant clam (Tridacna maxima) populations in the west Pacific is not consistent with dispersal by present-day ocean currents	EVOLUTION			English	Article						gene flow; giant clams; Indo-Pacific biogeography; marine species evolution; population genetics; Tridacna maxima	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; OF-THORNS STARFISH; POLYGENIC BEHAVIORAL TRAIT; SEA-URCHINS; ACANTHASTER-PLANCI; INDO-PACIFIC; CORAL SEA; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; GIGAS POPULATIONS	The Pacific marine biota, particularly species with long planktonic larval stages, are thought to disperse widely throughout the Pacific via ocean currents. The little genetic data available to date has supported this view in that little or no significant regional differentiation of populations has been found over large geographical distances. However, recent data from giant clams has demonstrated not only significant regional differentiation of populations, but routes of gene flow that run perpendicular to the main present-day ocean currents. Extensive surveys of genetic variation at eight polymorphic loci in 19 populations of the giant clam Tridacna maxima, sampled throughout the West and Central Pacific, confirmed that the patterns of variation seen so far in T. gigas were not unique to that species, and may reflect a fundamental genetic structuring of shallow-water marine taxa. Populations of T. maxima within highly connected reef systems like the Great Barrier Reef were panmictic (average F-ST < 0.003), but highly significant genetic differences between reef groups on different archipelagos (average F-ST = 0.084) and between West and Central Pacific regions (average F-ST = 0.156) were found. Inferred gene flew was high (N(c)m usually > 5) between the Philippines and the Great Barrier Reef, between the Philippines and Melanesia (the Solomon Islands and Fiji), and between the Philippines and the Central Pacific island groups (Marshall Islands, Kiribati, Tuvalu and Cook Islands). Gene flow was low between these three sets of island chains (N(c)m < 2). These routes of gene flow are perpendicular to present-day ocean currents. It is suggested that the spatial patterns of gene frequencies reflect past episodes of dispersal at times of lower sea levels which have not been erased by subsequent dispersal by present-day circulation. The patterns are consistent with extensive dispersal of marine species in the Pacific, and with traditional views of dispersal from the Indo-Malay region. However, they demonstrate that dispersal along present-day ocean surface currents cannot be assumed, that other mechanisms may operate today or that major dispersal events are intermittent (perhaps separated by several thousands of years), and that the nature and timing of dispersal of Pacific marine species is more complex than has been thought.

Pelagic early life stages promote connectivity in the demersal labrid Choerodon rubescens	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Baldchin Groper; Microsatellite; Larval dispersal; Early life stages; Population genetics; Reef fish	CORAL-REEF FISH; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; GENE FLOW; LARVAL DISPERSAL; SELF-RECRUITMENT; WINTER FLOUNDER; MARINE; PATTERNS; DIFFERENTIATION; MANAGEMENT	Population connectivity has profound ecological and evolutionary implications. In marine species with complex life cycles, the nature of these implications depends on both the amount of dispersal and the life-cycle stage(s) through which dispersal occurs. For demersal fishes with such life cycles, the pelagic early life stages (ELS) are generally considered the main dispersive phase, though this assumption has rarely been tested. This research investigates genetic connectivity in the reef-dwelling labrid Choerodon rubescens, which is a prized eating fish endemic to ca 1200 km of the west coast of Australia. This species has demersal juveniles and adults, and pelagic ELS that are predicted to last about 25-30 days. The aim of the study was to use patterns of variation at 12 microsatellite loci to test the hypothesis that C. rubescens is genetically homogeneous across its main distribution. The genetic analyses were based on samples of 26-40 individuals from six locations, which collectively span all of the areas where C rubescens is common. The values of global F-ST (0.0019) and D-EST (0.0010) were not significantly different from zero and Bayesian clustering indicated that all individuals belonged to a single genetic group. In addition, Mantel tests showed no evidence of isolation by distance. These results support the view that C. rubescens is genetically homogeneous over all or most of its geographic range. Since published otolith microchemistry evidence indicates that the juveniles and adults of C rubescens are relatively sedentary, these results also imply that the pelagic ELS are the main avenue of dispersal in this species. This study highlights the value of combining the results of complementary methods for assessing the relative importance of the different life-cycle stages in dispersing a fish species. The results also have implications for the management of C rubescens, which has shown signs of localised overfishing. Specifically, the dispersal of the ELS provides a mechanism for the recruitment of C rubescens to non-natal reefs. Such connectivity could help this species to recover from localised depletions in abundance and ameliorate the potential evolutionary consequences of any localised overfishing, such as reductions in genetic diversity or selective responses to harvesting.

Vicariance patterns in the Mediterranean Sea: east-west cleavage and low dispersal in the endemic seagrass Posidonia oceanica	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						clonal plant; contact zone; genetic divergence; glaciations; Mediterranean biogeography; microsatellites; Pleistocene; Posidonia oceanica speciation	SPATIAL GENETIC-STRUCTURE; CORAL-REEF FISH; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; POPULATION-GENETICS; L. DELILE; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; PLANT-POPULATIONS; TROPICAL PACIFIC; CLONAL ORGANISMS; ZOSTERA-MARINA	Aim The seagrass, Posidonia oceanica is a,clonal angiosperm endemic to the Mediterranean Sea. Previous studies have suggested that clonal growth is far greater than sexual recruitment and thus leads to low clonal diversity within meadows. However, recently developed microsatellite markers indicate that there are many different genotypes, and therefore many distinct clones present. The low resolution of markers used in the past limited our ability to estimate clonality and assess the individual level. New high-resolution dinucleotide microsatellites now allow genetically distinct individuals to be identified, enabling more reliable estimation of population genetic parameters across the Mediterranean Basin. We investigated the biogeography and dispersal of P. oceanica at various spatial scales in order to assess the influence of different evolutionary factors shaping the distribution of genetic diversity in this species. Location The Mediterranean. Methods We used seven hypervariable microsatellite markers, in addition to the five previously existing markers, to describe the spatial distribution of genetic variability in 34 meadows spread throughout the Mediterranean, on the basis of an average of 35.6 ( +/- 6.3) ramets sampled. Results At the scale of the Mediterranean Sea as a whole, a strong east-west cleavage was detected (AMOVA). These results are in line with those obtained using previous markers. The new results showed the presence of a putative secondary contact zone at the Siculo-Tunisian Strait, which exhibited high allelic richness and shared alleles absent from the eastern and western basins. F statistics (pairwise theta ranges between 0.09 and 0.71) revealed high genetic structure between meadows, both at a small scale (about 2 to 200 km) and at a medium scale within the eastern and western basins, independent of geographical distance. At the intrameadow scale, significant spatial autocorrelation in six out of 15 locations revealed that dispersal can be restricted to the scale of a few metres. Main conclusions A stochastic pattern of effective migration due to low population size, turnover and seed survival is the most likely explanation for this pattern of highly restricted gene flow, despite the importance of an a priori seed dispersal potential. The east-west cleavage probably represents the outline of vicariance caused by the last Pleistocene ice age and maintained to this day by low gene flow. These results emphasize the diversity of evolutionary processes shaping the genetic structure at different spatial scales.

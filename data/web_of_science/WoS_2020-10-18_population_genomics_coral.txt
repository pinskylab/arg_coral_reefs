Genomic signatures of host-associated divergence and adaptation in a coral-eating snail, Coralliophila violacea (Kiener, 1836)	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						adaptation; coral reefs; ecological divergence; gastropods; population genomics; RAD-seq	ECOLOGICAL SPECIATION; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; GENE FLOW; NATURAL-SELECTION; IMMIGRANT INVIABILITY; SYMPATRIC SPECIATION; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; SPECIALIZATION; RACES; DIVERSIFICATION	The fluid nature of the ocean, combined with planktonic dispersal of marine larvae, lowers physical barriers to gene flow. However, divergence can still occur despite gene flow if strong selection acts on populations occupying different ecological niches. Here, we examined the population genomics of an ectoparasitic snail, Coralliophila violacea (Kiener 1836), that specializes on Porites corals in the Indo-Pacific. Previous genetic analyses revealed two sympatric lineages associated with different coral hosts. In this study, we examined the mechanisms promoting and maintaining the snails' adaptation to their coral hosts. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from type II restriction site-associated DNA (2b-RAD) sequencing revealed two differentiated clusters of C. violacea that were largely concordant with coral host, consistent with previous genetic results. However, the presence of some admixed genotypes indicates gene flow from one lineage to the other. Combined, these results suggest that differentiation between host-associated lineages of C. violacea is occurring in the face of ongoing gene flow, requiring strong selection. Indeed, 2.7% of all SNP loci were outlier loci (73/2,718), indicative of divergence with gene flow, driven by adaptation of each C. violacea lineage to their specific coral hosts.

Demographic histories shape population genomics of the common coral grouper (Plectropomus leopardus)	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS			English	Article						fisheries management; molecular evolution; population genetics - empirical	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; R-PACKAGE; SPAWNING AGGREGATIONS; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; FISH; TROUT; DIVERGENCE; SEA; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; ADAPTATION	Many coral reef fishes display remarkable genetic and phenotypic variation across their geographic ranges. Understanding how historical and contemporary processes have shaped these patterns remains a focal question in evolutionary biology since they reveal how diversity is generated and how it may respond to future environmental change. Here, we compare the population genomics and demographic histories of a commercially and ecologically important coral reef fish, the common coral grouper (Plectropomus leopardus [Lacepede 1802]), across two adjoining regions (the Great Barrier Reef; GBR, and the Coral Sea, Australia) spanning approximately 14 degrees of latitude and 9 degrees of longitude. We analysed 4548 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers across 11 sites and show that genetic connectivity between regions is low, despite their relative proximity (similar to 100km) and an absence of any obvious geographic barrier. Inferred demographic histories using 10,479 markers suggest that the Coral Sea population was founded by a small number of GBR individuals and that divergence occurred similar to 190 kya under a model of isolation with asymmetric migration. We detected population expansions in both regions, but estimates of contemporary effective population sizes were approximately 50% smaller in Coral Sea sites, which also had lower genetic diversity. Our results suggest that P. leopardus in the Coral Sea have experienced a long period of isolation that precedes the recent glacial period (similar to 10-120 kya) and may be vulnerable to localized disturbances due to their relative reliance on local larval replenishment. While it is difficult to determine the underlying events that led to the divergence of the Coral Sea and GBR lineages, we show that even geographically proximate populations of a widely dispersed coral reef fish can have vastly different evolutionary histories.

Trans-Pacific RAD-Seq population genomics confirms introgressive hybridization in Eastern Pacific Pocillopora corals	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Phylogeography; Population genomics; Hybridization; Transcriptomics; Restriction-site Associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-Seq); Reef corals	GENUS PSAMMOCORA CNIDARIA; SPECIES BOUNDARIES; INTERSPECIFIC HYBRIDIZATION; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; SCLERACTINIAN CORALS; GENETIC ARCHITECTURE; SNP DISCOVERY; REEF CORALS; SPECIATION; EVOLUTION	Discrepancies between morphology-based taxonomy and phylogenetic systematics are common in Scleractinian corals. In Pocillopora corals, nine recently identified genetic lineages disagree fundamentally with the 17 recognized Pocillopora species, including 5 major Indo-Pacific reef-builders. Pocillopora corals hybridize in the Tropical Eastern Pacific, so it is possible that some of the disagreement between the genetics and taxonomy may be due to introgressive hybridization. Here we used 6769 genome-wide SNPs from Restriction-site Associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-Seq) to conduct phylogenomic comparisons among three common, Indo-Pacific Pocillopora species - P. damicomis, P. eydouxi and P. elegans - within and between populations in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) and the Central Pacific. Genome-wide RAD-Seq comparisons of Central and TEP Pocillopora confirm that the morphospecies P. damicornis, P. eydouxi and P. elegans are not monophyletic, but instead fall into three distinct genetic groups. However, hybrid samples shared fixed alleles with their respective parental species and, even without strict monophyly, P. damicomis share a common set of 33 species-specific alleles across the Pacific. RAD-Seq data confirm the pattern of one-way introgressive hybridization among TEP Pocillopora, suggesting that introgression may play a role in generating shared, polyphyletic lineages among currently recognized Pocillopora species. Levels of population differentiation within genetic lineages indicate significantly higher levels of population differentiation in the Tropical Eastern Pacific than in the Central West Pacific.

Signatures of selection underpinning rapid coral adaptation to the world's warmest reefs	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; BLEACHING EVENT; GENE-EXPRESSION; HEAT TOLERANCE; ARABIAN GULF; STRESS; INSIGHTS; SEA; CONNECTIVITY; FLUORESCENCE	Coral populations in the world's warmest reefs, the Persian/Arabian Gulf (PAG), represent an ideal model system to understand the evolutionary response of coral populations to past and present environmental change and to identify genomic loci that contribute to elevated thermal tolerance. Here, we use population genomics of the brain coral Platygyra daedalea to show that corals in the PAG represent a distinct subpopulation that was established during the Holocene marine transgression, and identify selective sweeps in their genomes associated with thermal adaptation. We demonstrate the presence of positive and disruptive selection and provide evidence for selection of differentially methylated haplotypes. While demographic analyses suggest limited potential for genetic rescue of neighboring Indian Ocean reefs, the presence of putative targets of selection in corals outside of the PAG offers hope that loci associated with thermal tolerance may be present in the standing genetic variation.

However, rampant geographical variation in the strength and direction of such correlations can be particularly difficult to explain through generalized mechanisms. By integrating population genomics, surveys of natural history collections and spatially explicit analyses, we tested multiple drivers of trait correlations in a coral snake mimic that exhibits remarkable polymorphism in mimetic and non-mimetic colour traits. We found that although such traits co-occur extensively across space, correlations were best explained by a mixture of genetic architecture and correlational selection, rather than by any single mechanism. Our findings suggest that spatially complex trait distributions may be driven more by the simple interaction between multiple processes than by complex variation in one mechanism alone. These interactions are particularly important in mimicry systems, which frequently generate striking geographical variation and genetic correlations among colour pattern traits.

In contrast, the Kerama Islands (KIs) only 30 km west of OI, have continuously hosted a great variety of healthy corals. Taking advantage of the decoded Acropora digitifera genome and using genome-wide SNP analyses, we clarified Acropora population structure in the southern Ryukyu Archipelago (sRA). Despite small genetic distances, we identified distinct clusters corresponding to specific island groups, suggesting infrequent long-distance dispersal within the sRA. Although the KIs were believed to supply coral larvae to OI, admixture analyses showed that such dispersal is much more limited than previously realized, indicating independent recovery of OI coral populations and the necessity of local conservation efforts for each region. We detected strong historical migration from the Yaeyama Islands (YIs) to OI, and suggest that the YIs are the original source of OI corals. In addition, migration edges to the KIs suggest that they are a historical sink population in the sRA, resulting in high diversity. This population genomics study provides the highest resolution data to date regarding coral population structure and history.

To estimate population connectivity in Singapore's urbanized equatorial reef system, we analysed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from two species of reef-building corals with distinct life histories. For Porites sp., a broadcast-spawning coral, we found cryptic lineages that were differentially distributed at inshore and central-offshore sites that could be attributed to contemporary surface current regimes. Near panmixia was observed for Pocillopora acuta with differentiation of colonies at the farthest site from mainland Singapore, a possible consequence of the brooding nature and relatively long pelagic larval duration of the species. Furthermore, analysis of recent gene flow showed that 60-80% of colonies in each population were nonmigrants, underscoring self-recruitment as an important demographic process in this reef system. Apart from helping to enhance the management of Singapore's coral reef ecosystems, findings here pave the way for better understanding of the evolution of marine populations in South-East Asia.

Potential and limits for rapid genetic adaptation to warming in a Great Barrier Reef coral	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; POPULATION-SIZE; SCLERACTINIAN CORALS; GENOTYPIC DIVERSITY; ACROPORA-MILLEPORA; BUILDING CORALS; HEAT TOLERANCE; CONNECTIVITY; MARINE; GENOME	Can genetic adaptation in reef-building corals keep pace with the current rate of sea surface warming? Here we combine population genomics, biophysical modeling, and evolutionary simulations to predict future adaptation of the common coral Acropora millepora on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Genomics-derived migration rates were high (0.1-1% of immigrants per generation across half the latitudinal range of the GBR) and closely matched the biophysical model of larval dispersal. Both genetic and biophysical models indicated the prevalence of southward migration along the GBR that would facilitate the spread of heat-tolerant alleles to higher latitudes as the climate warms. We developed an individual-based metapopulation model of polygenic adaptation and parameterized it with population sizes and migration rates derived from the genomic analysis. We find that high migration rates do not disrupt local thermal adaptation, and that the resulting standing genetic variation should be sufficient to fuel rapid region-wide adaptation of A. millepora populations to gradual warming over the next 20-50 coral generations (100-250 years). Further adaptation based on novel mutations might also be possible, but this depends on the currently unknown genetic parameters underlying coral thermal tolerance and the rate of warming realized. Despite this capacity for adaptation, our model predicts that coral populations would become increasingly sensitive to random thermal fluctuations such as ENSO cycles or heat waves, which corresponds well with the recent increase in frequency of catastrophic coral bleaching events.

Recently, two Heliopora species were delimited by DNA markers: HC-A and HC-B. To clarify the genomic divergence of these Heliopora species (HC-A and HC-B) from sympatric and allopatric populations in Okinawa, Japan, we used a high throughput reduced representation genomic DNA sequencing approach (ezRAD). Results We found 6742 biallelic SNPs shared among all target populations, which successfully distinguished the HC-A and HC-B species in both the sympatric and allopatric populations, with no evidence of hybridization between the two. In addition, we detected 410 fixed SNPs linking functional gene differences, including heat resilience and reproductive timing, between HC-A and HC-B. Conclusions We confirmed clear genomic divergence between Heliopora species and found possible genes related to stress-responses and reproduction, which may shed light on the speciation process and ecological divergence of coral species.

Here, we develop the first genomic resources and reproducible workflows for two threatened members of the reef-building coral genus Acropora. We generated genomic sequence data from multiple samples of the Caribbean A. cervicornis (staghorn coral) and A. palmata (elkhorn coral), and predicted millions of nucleotide variants among these two species and the Pacific A. digitifera. A subset of predicted nucleotide variants were verified using restriction length polymorphism assays and proved useful in distinguishing the two Caribbean acroporids and the hybrid they form ("A. prolifera"). Nucleotide variants are freely available from the Galaxy server (usegalaxy.org), and can be analyzed there with computational tools and stored workflows that require only an internet browser. We describe these data and some of the analysis tools, concentrating on fixed differences between A. cervicornis and A. palmata. In particular, we found that fixed amino acid differences between these two species were enriched in proteins associated with development, cellular stress response, and the host's interactions with associated microbes, for instance in the ABC transporters and superoxide dismutase. Identified candidate genes may underlie functional differences in how these threatened species respond to changing environments. Users can expand the presented analyses easily by adding genomic data from additional species, as they become available.	[Kitchen, Sheila.

A genomic glance through the fog of plasticity and diversification in Pocillopora	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CORAL GENUS POCILLOPORA; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; SCLERACTINIAN CORALS; SPECIES DELIMITATION; MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME; POPULATION GENOMICS; GENERATION; GENETICS; RADSEQ; TOOL	Scleractinian corals of the genus Pocillopora (Lamarck, 1816) are notoriously difficult to identify morphologically with considerable debate on the degree to which phenotypic plasticity, introgressive hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting obscure well-defined taxonomic lineages. Here, we used RAD-seq to resolve the phylogenetic relationships among seven species of Pocillopora represented by 15 coral holobiont metagenomic libraries. We found strong concordance between the coral holobiont datasets, reads that mapped to the Pocillopora damicornis (Linnaeus, 1758) transcriptome, nearly complete mitochondrial genomes, 430 unlinked high-quality SNPs shared across all Pocillopora taxa, and a conspecificity matrix of the holobiont dataset. These datasets also show strong concordance with previously published clustering of the mitochondrial clades based on the mtDNA open reading frame (ORF). We resolve seven clear monophyletic groups, with no evidence for introgressive hybridization among any but the most recently derived sister species. In contrast, ribosomal and histone datasets, which are most commonly used in coral phylogenies to date, were less informative and contradictory to these other datasets. These data indicate that extant Pocillopora species diversified from a common ancestral lineage within the last similar to 3 million years. Key to this evolutionary success story may be the high phenotypic plasticity exhibited by Pocillopora species.	[Johnston, Erika C.; Forsman, Zac H.; Knapp, Ingrid S.

Furthermore, endosymbiotic algae within coral host species can confer adaptive responses to environmental stress and may represent additional axes of coral genetic variation that are not constrained by taxonomic divergence of the cnidarian host. Here, we examine genetic variation in a common and widespread, reef-building coral, Acropora tenuis, and its associated endosymbiotic algae along the entire expanse of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). We use SNPs derived from genome-wide sequencing to characterize the cnidarian coral host and organelles from zooxanthellate endosymbionts (genus Cladocopium). We discover three distinct and sympatric genetic clusters of coral hosts, whose distributions appear associated with latitude and inshore-offshore reef position. Demographic modelling suggests that the divergence history of the three distinct host taxa ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 million years ago, preceding the GBR's formation, and has been characterized by low-to-moderate ongoing inter-taxon gene flow, consistent with occasional hybridization and introgression typifying coral evolution. Despite this differentiation in the cnidarian host, A. tenuis taxa share a common symbiont pool, dominated by the genus Cladocopium (Clade C). Cladocopium plastid diversity is not strongly associated with host identity but varies with reef location relative to shore: inshore colonies contain lower symbiont diversity on average but have greater differences between colonies as compared with symbiont communities from offshore colonies. Spatial genetic patterns of symbiont communities could reflect local selective pressures maintaining coral holobiont differentiation across an inshore-offshore environmental gradient. The strong influence of environment (but not host identity) on symbiont community composition supports the notion that symbiont community composition responds to habitat and may assist in the adaptation of corals to future environmental change.

Holobiont Diversity in a Reef-Building Coral over Its Entire Depth Range in the Mesophotic Zone	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						mesophotic coral ecosystems; holobiont; Agaricia undata; endosymbiont; coral reefs; Symbiodinium	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; MONTASTRAEA-CAVERNOSA; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; CARIBBEAN SEA; ECOLOGY; SHALLOW; HOST; PATTERNS; LOCI; SCLERACTINIA	Mesophotic reef-building coral communities (similar to 30-120 m depth) remain largely unexplored, despite representing roughly three-quarters of the overall depth range at which tropical coral reef ecosystems occur. Although many coral species are restricted to shallow depths, several species occur across large depth ranges, including lower mesophotic depths. Yet, it remains unclear how such species can persist under extreme low-light conditions and how the different symbiotic partners associated with these corals contribute to facilitate such broad depth ranges. We assessed holobiont genetic diversity of the Caribbean coral Agaricia undata over depth in three localities of Colombia: San Andres Island (between 37 and 85 m), Cartagena (between 17 and 45 m) and "Parque Nacional Natural Corales de Profundidad" (between 77 and 87 m). We used a population genomics approach (NextRAD) for the coral host, and amplicon sequencing for the associated Symbiodinium (non-coding region of the plastid psbA minicircle) and prokaryotic (V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene) symbiont community. For the coral host, genetic structuring was only observed across geographic regions, but not between depths. Bayesian clustering and discriminant analysis of principal components revealed genetic structuring between the three regions, but not between shallow (<30 m), upper (>= 30 and <= 60 m) and lower mesophotic (>60 m) depths. This pattern was confirmed when evaluating pairwise differentiation (F-ST) between populations, with much higher values between regions (0.0467-0.1034) compared to between depths [within location; -0.0075-(-0.0007)]. Symbiotic partners, including seven types of zooxanthellae and 325 prokaryotic OTUs, did not exhibit partitioning across depths. All samples hosted Symbiodinium Glade C3 and the type C3psbA_e was present in all depths. Alpha microbial diversity was not significantly different between zones (upper vs. lower), which community composition between coral colonies was similar in the two zones (ANOSIM, R = -0.079, P > 0.05). The coral microbiome was dominated by Uncultured Betaproteobacteria in the order EC94 (16%), Unknown-Bacteria (15%), family Cenarchaeaceae (12 %), Burkholderiaceae (10%), and Hahellaceae (10%). The constant coral-holobiont composition along the studied depth range suggests that identity of the symbionts is not responsible for the coral's broad depth range and adaptation to low light environments.

One of the central challenges remains that there are few informative genetic markers for studying boundaries between species, and variation within species. Reduced representation sequencing approaches, such as RADseq (Restriction site Associated DNA sequencing) have great potential for resolving such relationships. However, it is necessary to identify loci in order to make inferences for endosymbiotic organisms such as corals. Here, we examined twenty-one coral holobiont ezRAD libraries from Hawaii, focusing on P. lobata and P. compressa, two species with contrasting morphology and habitat preference that previous studies have not resolved. We used a combination of de novo assembly and reference mapping approaches to identify and compare loci: we used reference mapping to extract and compare nearly complete mitochondrial genomes, ribosomal arrays, and histone genes. We used de novo clustering and phylogenomic methods to compare the complete holobiont data set with coral and symbiont subsets that map to transcriptomic data. In addition, we used reference assemblies to examine genetic structure from SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms). All approaches resolved outgroup taxa but failed to resolve P. lobata and P. compressa as distinct, with mito-nuclear discordance and shared mitochondrial haplotypes within the species complex. The holobiont and 'coral transcriptomic' datasets were highly concordant, revealing stronger genetic structure between sites than between coral morphospecies. These results suggest that either branching morphology is a polymorphic trait, or that these species frequently hybridize. This study provides examples of several approaches to acquire, identify, and compare loci across metagenomic samples such as the coral holobiont while providing insights into the nature of coral variability.

Genetic divergence and range expansion in a western North Pacific coral	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Range expansion; Coral; 2bRAD-seq; Cryptic lineage; Adaptation; Population genomics	CLIMATE-CHANGE; DELETERIOUS MUTATIONS; DEMOGRAPHIC HISTORY; READ ALIGNMENT; RYUKYU ISLANDS; POPULATION; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; DIFFERENTIATION; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY	Coral poleward range expansions have recently been observed in response to warming oceans. Range expansion can lead to reduced genetic diversity and increased frequency of deleterious mutations that were rare in core populations, potentially limiting the ability for adaptation and persistence in novel environments. Successful expansions that overcome these founder effects and colonize new habitat have been attributed to multiple introductions from different sources, hybridization with native populations, or rapid adaptive evolution. Here, we investigate population genomic patterns of the reef-building coral Acropora hyacinthus along a latitudinal cline that includes a well-established range expansion front in Japan using 2b-RAD sequencing. A total of 184 coral samples were collected across seven sites spanning from similar to 24 degrees N to near its northern range front at similar to 33 degrees N. We uncover the presence of three cryptic lineages of A. hyacinthus, which occupy discrete reefs within this region. Only one lineage is present along the expansion front and we find evidence for its historical occupation of marginal habitats. Within this lineage we also find evidence of bottleneck pressures associated with expansion events including higher clonality, increased linkage disequilibrium, and lower genetic diversity in range edge populations compared to core populations. Asymmetric migration between populations was also detected with lower migration from edge sites. Lastly, we describe genomic signatures of local adaptation potentially attributed to lower winter temperatures experienced at the more recently expanded northern populations. 'together these data illuminate the genomic consequences of range expansion in a coral and highlight how adaptation to discrete environments along expansion fronts may facilitate further range expansion in this temperate coral lineage.

Genomic variation among populations of threatened coral: Acropora cervicornis	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Genotyping by sequencing; Coral reefs; Population genomics; Restoration genetics; Florida reef tract	REEF-BUILDING CORAL; CARIBBEAN CORAL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; READ ALIGNMENT; NORTH-ATLANTIC; DIVERSITY; RESTORATION; SOFTWARE; PALMATA; FLORIDA	Background: Acropora cervicornis, a threatened, keystone reef-building coral has undergone severe declines (>90 %) throughout the Caribbean. These declines could reduce genetic variation and thus hamper the species' ability to adapt. Active restoration strategies are a common conservation approach to mitigate species' declines and require genetic data on surviving populations to efficiently respond to declines while maintaining the genetic diversity needed to adapt to changing conditions. To evaluate active restoration strategies for the staghorn coral, the genetic diversity of A. cervicornis within and among populations was assessed in 77 individuals collected from 68 locations along the Florida Reef Tract (FRT) and in the Dominican Republic. Results: Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) identified 4,764 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Pairwise nucleotide differences (p) within a population are large (similar to 37 %) and similar to p across all individuals. This high level of genetic diversity along the FRT is similar to the diversity within a small, isolated reef. Much of the genetic diversity (> 90 %) exists within a population, yet GBS analysis shows significant variation along the FRT, including 300 SNPs with significant F-ST values and significant divergence relative to distance. There are also significant differences in SNP allele frequencies over small spatial scales, exemplified by the large F-ST values among corals collected within Miami-Dade county. Conclusions: Large standing diversity was found within each population even after recent declines in abundance, including significant, potentially adaptive divergence over short distances. The data here inform conservation and management actions by uncovering population structure and high levels of diversity maintained within coral collections among sites previously shown to have little genetic divergence. More broadly, this approach demonstrates the power of GBS to resolve differences among individuals and identify subtle genetic structure, informing conservation goals with evolutionary implications.

Mechanisms of Thermal Tolerance in Reef-Building Corals across a Fine-Grained Environmental Mosaic: Lessons from Ofu, American Samoa	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Review						phenotypic plasticity; polygenic adaptation; coral reefs; thermal tolerance; acclimatization; Acropora	CLIMATE-CHANGE; LOCAL ADAPTATION; GENE FLOW; POPULATION GENOMICS; HEAT-STRESS; MONTASTRAEA-ANNULARIS; ADAPTIVE DIVERGENCE; POLYGENIC SELECTION; PORITES-ASTREOIDES; BACK REEF	Environmental heterogeneity gives rise to phenotypic variation through a combination of phenotypic plasticity and fixed genetic effects. For reef-building corals, understanding the relative roles of acclimatization and adaptation in generating thermal tolerance is fundamental to predicting the response of coral populations to future climate change. The temperature mosaic in the lagoon of Ofu, American Samoa, represents an ideal natural laboratory for studying thermal tolerance in corals. Two adjacent back-reef pools approximately 500m apart have different temperature profiles: the highly variable (HV) pool experiences temperatures that range from 24.5 to 35 degrees C, whereas the moderately variable (MV) pool ranges from 25 to 32 degrees C. Standardized heat stress tests have shown that corals native to the HV pool have consistently higher levels of bleaching resistance than those in the MV pool. In this review, we summarize research into the mechanisms underlying this variation in bleaching resistance, focusing on the important reef-building genus Acropora. Both acclimatization and adaptation occur strongly and define thermal tolerance differences between pools. Most individual corals shift physiology to become more heat resistant when moved into the warmer pool. Lab based tests show that these shifts begin in as little as a week and are equally sparked by exposure to periodic high temperatures as constant high temperatures. Transcriptome-wide data on gene expression show that a wide variety of genes are co-regulated in expression modules that change expression after experimental heat stress, after acclimatization, and even after short term environmental fluctuations. Population genetic scans show associations between a corals' thermal environment and its alleles at 100s to 1000s of nuclear genes and no single gene confers strong environmental effects within or between species. Symbionts also tend to differ between pools and species, and the thermal tolerance of a coral is a reflection of individual host genotype and specific symbiont types. We conclude the review by placing this work in the context of parallel research going on in other species, reefs, and ecosystems around the world and into the broader framework of reef coral resilience in the face of climate change.

New approaches to species delimitation and population structure of anthozoans: Two case studies of octocorals using ultraconserved elements and exons	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES			English	Article						Cnidaria; Octocorallia; population genomics; target enrichment; UCE	SOFT CORAL GENUS; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; MOLECULAR EVIDENCE; REEF FISHES; EVOLUTION; ATLANTIC; DEEP; TREE; HYBRIDIZATION; POCILLOPORA	As coral populations decline worldwide in the face of ongoing environmental change, documenting their distribution, diversity and conservation status is now more imperative than ever. Accurate delimitation and identification of species is a critical first step. This task, however, is not trivial as morphological variation and slowly evolving molecular markers confound species identification. New approaches to species delimitation in corals are needed to overcome these challenges. Here, we test whether target enrichment of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and exons can be used for delimiting species boundaries and population structure within species of corals by focusing on two octocoral genera,AlcyoniumandSinularia, as exemplary case studies. We designed an updated bait set (29,181 baits) to target-capture 3,023 UCE and exon loci, recovering a mean of 1,910 +/- 168SDper sample with a mean length of 1,055 +/- 208 bp. Similar numbers of loci were recovered fromSinularia(1,946 +/- 227SD) andAlcyonium(1,863 +/- 177SD). Species-level phylogenies were highly supported for both genera. Clustering methods based on filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms delimited species and populations that are congruent with previous allozyme, DNA barcoding, reproductive and ecological data forAlcyonium, and offered further evidence of hybridization among species. ForSinularia, results were congruent with those obtained from a previous study using restriction site associated DNA sequencing. Both case studies demonstrate the utility of target-enrichment of UCEs and exons to address a wide range of evolutionary and taxonomic questions across deep to shallow timescales in corals.

For this reason, the European Union Habitat Directive included them among priority habitats to be preserved. Although their ecological role is well established, connectivity patterns are still poorly investigated, representing a limit in conservation planning. The present study pioneers a novel approach for the analysis of connectivity in marine bioconstructor species, which often lack suitable genetic markers, by taking advantage of next-generation sequencing techniques. We assess the geographical patterns of genomic variation of the sunset cup coral Leptopsammia pruvoti Lacaze-Duthiers, 1897, an ahermatypic, non-zooxanthellate and solitary scleractinian coral species common in coralligenous habitats and distributed across the Mediterranean Sea. Location The Italian coastline (Western and Central Mediterranean). Methods We applied the restriction site-associated 2b-RAD approach to genotype over 1,000 high-quality and filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms in 10 population samples. Results The results revealed the existence of a strongly supported genetic structure, with highly significant pairwise F-ST values between all the population samples, including those collected about 5 km apart from each other. Moreover, genomic data indicate that the strongest barriers to gene flow are between the western (Ligurian-Tyrrhenian Sea) and the eastern side (Adriatic Sea) of the Italian peninsula. Main conclusions The strong differentiation found in L. pruvoti is similar to that found in other species of marine bioconstructors investigated in this area, but it strongly contrasts with the small differences found in many fish and invertebrates at the same geographical scale. All in one, our results highlight the importance of assessing connectivity in species belonging to coralligenous habitats as, due to their limited dispersal ability, they might require specific spatial conservation measures.

One emerging tool for this goal is high-throughput sequencing technology, which can now be used to scan the genome for signs of environmental selection in any species and any system. This explosion of data provides a powerful new window into the molecular mechanisms of adaptation, and although there has been some success in using genomic data to predict responses to selection in fields such as agriculture, thus far genomic data are rarely integrated into predictive frameworks of future adaptation in natural populations. Here, we review both theoretical and empirical studies of adaptation to rapid environmental change, focusing on areas where genomic data are poised to contribute to our ability to estimate species and population persistence and adaptation. We advocate for the need to study and model evolutionary response architectures, which integrate spatial information, fitness estimates, and plasticity with genetic architecture. Understanding how these factors contribute to adaptive responses is essential in efforts to predict the responses of species and ecosystems to future environmental change.

In marine systems, determining the scale, rate, and directionality of larval dispersal is therefore, central to understanding how coral metapopulations are interconnected and the degree of resiliency in the event of a localized disturbance. Understanding these source-sink dynamics is essential to guide restoration efforts and for the study of ecology and evolution in the ocean. The patterns and mechanisms of connectivity in the deep-sea (>200 m deep) are largely understudied. In this study, we investigated the spatial diversity patterns and metapopulation connectivity of the octocoral Paramuricea biscaya throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Paramuricea biscaya is one of the most abundant corals on the lower continental slope (between 1,200 and 2,500 m) in the GoM. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill (DWH) directly impacted populations of this species and thus are considered primary targets for restoration. We used a combination of seascape genomic analyses, high-resolution ocean circulation modeling, and larval dispersal simulations to quantify the degree of population structuring and connectivity among P. biscaya populations. Evidence supports the hypotheses that the genetic diversity of P. biscaya is structured by depth, and that larval dispersal among connected populations is asymmetric due to dominant ocean circulation patterns. Our results suggest that there are intermediate unsampled populations in the central GoM that serve as stepping stones for dispersal. The data suggest that the DeSoto Canyon area, and possibly the West Florida Escarpment, critically act as sources of larvae for areas impacted by the DWH oil spill in the Mississippi Canyon. This work illustrates that the management of deep-sea marine protected areas should incorporate knowledge of connectivity networks and depth-dependent processes throughout the water column.

J	Titus, BM; Daly, M				Titus, Benjamin M.; Daly, Marymegan			Population genomics for symbiotic anthozoans: can reduced representation approaches be used for taxa without reference genomes?	HEREDITY			English	Article							ANEMONES BARTHOLOMEA-ANNULATA; CORAL-ALGAL SYMBIOSIS; SEA-ANEMONES; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; CARIBBEAN CORAL; NUCLEAR MARKERS; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; REVEALS; MODEL; REEF	Population genetic studies of symbiotic anthozoans have been historically challenging because their endosymbioses with dinoflagellates have impeded marker development. Genomic approaches like reduced representation sequencing alleviate marker development issues but produce anonymous loci, and without a reference genome, it is unknown which organism is contributing to the observed patterns. Alternative methods such as bait-capture sequencing targeting Ultra-Conserved Elements are now possible but costly. Thus, RADseq remains attractive, but how useful are these methods for symbiotic anthozoan taxa without a reference genome to separate anthozoan from algal sequences? We explore this through a case-study using a double-digest RADseq dataset for the sea anemone Bartholomea annulata. We assembled a holobiont dataset (3854 loci) for 101 individuals, then used a reference genome to create an aposymbiotic dataset (1402 loci). For both datasets, we investigated population structure and used coalescent simulations to estimate demography and population parameters. We demonstrate complete overlap in the spatial patterns of genetic diversity, demographic histories, and population parameter estimates for holobiont and aposymbiotic datasets. We hypothesize that the unique combination of anthozoan biology, diversity of the endosymbionts, and the manner in which assembly programs identify orthologous loci alleviates the need for reference genomes in some circumstances. We explore this hypothesis by assembling an additional 21 datasets using the assembly programs pyRAD and Stacks. We conclude that RADseq methods are more tractable for symbiotic anthozoans without reference genomes than previously realized.

The main goal of this study was to assess how a population genomics framework could help delineate the genetic structure of the American lobster (Homarus americanus) throughout much of the species' range and increase the assignment success of individuals to their location of origin. We genotyped 10156 filtered SNPs using RAD sequencing to delineate genetic structure and perform population assignment for 586 American lobsters collected in 17 locations distributed across a large portion of the species' natural distribution range. Our results revealed the existence of a hierarchical genetic structure, first separating lobsters from the northern and southern part of the range (F-CT=0.0011; P-value=0.0002) and then revealing a total of 11 genetically distinguishable populations (mean F-ST=0.00185; CI: 0.0007-0.0021, P-value<0.0002), providing strong evidence for weak, albeit fine-scale population structuring within each region. A resampling procedure showed that assignment success was highest with a subset of 3000 SNPs having the highest F-ST. Applying Anderson's (Molecular Ecology Resources, 2010, 10, 701) method to avoid high-grading bias', 94.2% and 80.8% of individuals were correctly assigned to their region and location of origin, respectively. Lastly, we showed that assignment success was positively associated with sample size. These results demonstrate that using a large number of SNPs improves fine-scale population structure delineation and population assignment success in a context of weak genetic structure. We discuss the implications of these findings for the conservation and management of highly connected marine species, particularly regarding the geographic scale of demographic independence.

Little evidence of adaptation potential to ocean acidification in sea urchins living in "Future Ocean" conditions at a CO2 vent	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						calcifying invertebrates; carbon dioxide vents; ocean acidification; population genomics	POPULATION GENOMIC EVIDENCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TRANSGENERATIONAL PLASTICITY; ADAPTIVE DIFFERENTIATION; SEAWATER ACIDIFICATION; PARACENTROTUS-LIVIDUS; ECHINOMETRA-MATHAEI; CORAL-REEFS; DATA SETS; MARINE	Ocean acidification (OA) can be detrimental to calcifying marine organisms, with stunting of invertebrate larval development one of the most consistent responses. Effects are usually measured by short-term, within-generation exposure, an approach that does not consider the potential for adaptation. We examined the genetic response to OA of larvae of the tropical sea urchin Echinometra sp. C. raised on coral reefs that were either influenced by CO2 vents (pH 7.9, future OA condition) or nonvent control reefs (pH 8.2). We assembled a high quality de novo transcriptome of Echinometra embryos (8 hr) and pluteus larvae (48 hr) and identified 68,056 SNPs. We tested for outlier SNPs and functional enrichment in embryos and larvae raised from adults from the control or vent sites. Generally, highest F-ST values in embryos were observed between sites (intrinsic adaptation, most representative of the gene pool in the spawned populations). This comparison also had the highest number of outlier loci (40). In the other comparisons, classical adaptation (comparing larvae with adults from the control transplanted to either the control or vent conditions) and reverse adaptation (larvae from the vent site returned to the vent or explanted at the control), we only observed modest numbers of outlier SNPs (6-19) and only enrichment in two functional pathways. Most of the outliers detected were silent substitutions without adaptive potential. We conclude that there is little evidence of realized adaptation potential during early development, while some potential (albeit relatively low) exists in the intrinsic gene pool after more than one generation of exposure.

Unraveling hierarchical genetic structure in a marine metapopulation: A comparison of three high-throughput genotyping approaches	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						amplicon sequencing; coral reef; Elacatinus lori; population genomics; seascape genetics; SNP	POPULATION ASSIGNMENT; R-PACKAGE; PATTERNS; DISTANCE; FISH; HABITAT; MICROSATELLITES; DIFFERENTIATION; CONNECTIVITY; PERSPECTIVE	Marine metapopulations often exhibit subtle population structure that can be difficult to detect. Given recent advances in high-throughput sequencing, an emerging question is whether various genotyping approaches, in concert with improved sampling designs, will substantially improve our understanding of genetic structure in the sea. To address this question, we explored hierarchical patterns of structure in the coral reef fish Elacatinus lori using a high-resolution approach with respect to both genetic and geographic sampling. Previously, we identified three putative E. lori populations within Belize using traditional genetic markers and sparse geographic sampling: barrier reef and Turneffe Atoll; Glover's Atoll; and Lighthouse Atoll. Here, we systematically sampled individuals at similar to 10 km intervals throughout these reefs (1,129 individuals from 35 sites) and sequenced all individuals at three sets of markers: 2,418 SNPs; 89 microsatellites; and 57 nonrepetitive nuclear loci. At broad spatial scales, the markers were consistent with each other and with previous findings. At finer spatial scales, there was new evidence of genetic substructure, but our three marker sets differed slightly in their ability to detect these patterns. Specifically, we found subtle structure between the barrier reef and Turneffe Atoll, with SNPs resolving this pattern most effectively. We also documented isolation by distance within the barrier reef. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the number of loci (and alleles) had a strong effect on the detection of structure for all three marker sets, particularly at small spatial scales. Taken together, these results illustrate empirically that high-throughput genotyping data can elucidate subtle genetic structure at previously-undetected scales in a dispersive marine fish.

Association with more thermotolerant partners could contribute to resilience, but the genetic mechanisms controlling specificity of hosts for particular Symbiodinium types are poorly known. Here, we characterize wild populations of a sea anemone laboratory model system for anthozoan symbiosis, from contrasting environments in Caribbean Panama. Patterns of anemone abundance and symbiont diversity were consistent with specialization of holobionts for particular habitats, with Exaiptasia pallida/S.minutum (ITS2 type B1) abundant on vertical substrate in thermally stable, shaded environments but E.brasiliensis/Symbiodinium sp. (ITS2 clade A) more common in shallow areas subject to high temperature and irradiance. Population genomic sequencing revealed a novel E.pallida population from the Bocas del Toro Archipelago that only harbors S.minutum. Loci most strongly associated with divergence of the Bocas-specific population were enriched in genes with putative roles in cnidarian symbiosis, including activators of the complement pathway of the innate immune system, thrombospondin-type-1 repeat domain proteins, and coordinators of endocytic recycling. Our findings underscore the importance of unmasking cryptic diversity in natural populations and the role of long-term evolutionary history in mediating interactions with Symbiodinium.

Here, we use a genome wide set of 14 559 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify the likely source population for this recruitment event. Most loci (76%) showed low genetic divergence across the species' range, indicating high levels of gene flow and confirming previous findings using neutral microsatellite markers. However, a small proportion of loci showed strong patterns of differentiation and exhibited patterns of population structure consistent with local adaptation. Clustering analyses based on these outlier loci indicated that recruits at the southern end of C. rubescens' range originated 400 km to the north, at the centre of the species' range, where average temperatures are up to 3 degrees C warmer. Survival of these recruits may be low because they carry alleles adapted to an environment different to the one they now reside in, but their survival is key to establishing locally adapted populations at and beyond the range edge as water temperatures increase with climate change.

Genome-wide SNPs clarify lineage diversity confused by coloration in coralsnakes of the Micrurus diastema species complex (Serpentes: Elapidae)	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Biogeography; Central America; Snake evolution; Systematics	CORAL-SNAKE PATTERN; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; INFERENCE; RECOGNITION; DIVERGENCE; PREDATORS; DISPERSAL; SELECTION; SOFTWARE; CAPTURE	New world coralsnakes of the genus Micrurus are a diverse radiation of highly venomous and brightly colored snakes that range from North Carolina to Argentina. Species in this group have played central roles in developing and testing hypotheses about the evolution of mimicry and aposematism. Despite their diversity and prominence as model systems, surprisingly little is known about species boundaries and phylogenetic relationships within Micrurus, which has substantially hindered meaningful analyses of their evolutionary history. Here we use mitochondrial genes together with thousands of nuclear genomic loci obtained via ddRADseq to study the phylogenetic relationships and population genomics of a subclade of the genus Micrurus: The M. diastema species complex. Our results indicate that prior species and species-group inferences based on morphology and color pattern have grossly misguided taxonomy, and that the M. diastema complex is not monophyletic. Based on our analyses of molecular data, we infer the phylogenetic relationships among species and populations, and provide a revised taxonomy for the group. Two non-sister species-complexes with similar color patterns are recognized, the M. distans and the M. diastema complexes, the first being basal to the monadal Micrurus and the second encompassing most North American monadal taxa. We examined all 13 species, and their respective subspecies, for a total of 24 recognized taxa in the M. diastema species complex. Our analyses suggest a reduction to 10 species, with no subspecific designations warranted, to be a more likely estimate of species diversity, namely, M. apiatus, M. browni, M. diastema, M. distans, M. ephippifer, M. fulvius, M. michoacanensis, M. oliveri, M. tener, and one undescribed species.

J	Picq, S; McMillan, WO; Puebla, O				Picq, Sophie; McMillan, W. Owen; Puebla, Oscar			Population genomics of local adaptation versus speciation in coral reef fishes (Hypoplectrus spp, Serranidae)	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Fish; local adaptation; marine; RAD sequencing; speciation	COLOR MORPHS; DE-NOVO; MARINE; DIVERGENCE; SCALE; DIFFERENTIATION; ORIGIN; TOOL; CONSEQUENCES; TROPOMYOSIN	Are the population genomic patterns underlying local adaptation and the early stages of speciation similar? Addressing this question requires a system in which (i) local adaptation and the early stages of speciation can be clearly identified and distinguished, (ii) the amount of genetic divergence driven by the two processes is similar, and (iii) comparisons can be repeated both taxonomically (for local adaptation) and geographically (for speciation). Here, we report just such a situation in the hamlets (Hypoplectrus spp), brightly colored reef fishes from the wider Caribbean. Close to 100,000 SNPs genotyped in 126 individuals from three sympatric species sampled in three repeated populations provide genome-wide levels of divergence that are comparable among allopatric populations (F-st estimate=0.0042) and sympatric species (F-st estimate=0.0038). Population genetic, clustering, and phylogenetic analyses reveal very similar patterns for local adaptation and speciation, with a large fraction of the genome undifferentiated (F-st estimate approximate to 0), a very small proportion of F-st outlier loci (0.05-0.07%), and remarkably few repeated outliers (1-3). Nevertheless, different loci appear to be involved in the two processes in Hypoplectrus, with only 7% of the most differentiated SNPs and outliers shared between populations and species comparisons. In particular, a tropomyosin (Tpm4) and a previously identified hox (HoxCa) locus emerge as candidate loci (repeated outliers) for local adaptation and speciation, respectively. We conclude that marine populations may be locally adapted notwithstanding shallow levels of genetic divergence, and that from a population genomic perspective, this process does not appear to differ fundamentally from the early stages of speciation.

Horizontal transmission enables flexible associations with locally adapted symbiont strains in deep-sea hydrothermal vent symbioses	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						chemosynthetic symbiosis; hydrothermal vents; host-symbiont population genomics; habitat adaptation; symbiont transmission and specificity	CORAL ENDOSYMBIONTS; GENOME; ANNOTATION; COMMUNITIES; ADAPTATION; GASTROPODS; DISPERSAL; OXIDATION; VERSATILE; CHEMISTRY	Symbiont specificity, both at the phylotype and strain level, can have profound consequences for host ecology and evolution. However, except for insights from a few model symbiosis systems, the degree of partner fidelity and the influence of host versus environmental factors on symbiont composition are still poorly understood. Nutritional symbioses between invertebrate animals and chemosynthetic bacteria at deep-sea hydrothermal vents are examples of relatively selective associations, where hosts affiliate only with particular, environmentally acquired phylotypes of gammaproteobacterial or campylobacterial symbionts. In hydrothermal vent snails of the sister genera Alviniconcha and Ifremeria, this phylotype specificity has been shown to play a role in habitat distribution and partitioning among different holobiont species. However, it is currently unknown if fidelity goes beyond species-level associations and influences genetic structuring, connectivity, and habitat adaptation of holobiont populations. We used metagenomic analyses to assess sequence variation in hosts and symbionts and identify correlations with geographic and environmental factors. Our analyses indicate that host populations are not differentiated across an similar to 800-km gradient, while symbiont populations are clearly structured between vent locations due to a combination of neutral and selective processes. Overall, these results suggest that host individuals flexibly associate with locally adapted strains of their specific symbiont phylotypes, which supports a long-standing but untested paradigm of the benefits of horizontal transmission. Symbiont strain flexibility in these snails likely enables host populations to exploit a range of habitat conditions, which might favor widespread genetic connectivity and ecological resilience unless physical dispersal barriers are present.

Genomic Assessment of Global Population Structure in a Highly Migratory and Habitat Versatile Apex Predator, the Tiger Shark (Galeocerdo cuvier)	JOURNAL OF HEREDITY			English	Article						genetic adaptation; genetic connectivity; elasmobranch; single nucleotide polymorphism	R-PACKAGE; MOVEMENT PATTERNS; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; MARINE PREDATOR; SELECTION; LOCI; ASSOCIATION; DIVERSITY; INFERENCE; ATLANTIC	Understanding the population dynamics of highly mobile, widely distributed, oceanic sharks, many of which are overexploited, is necessary to aid their conservation management. We investigated the global population genomics of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), a circumglobally distributed, apex predator displaying remarkable behavioral versatility in its diet, habitat use (near coastal, coral reef, pelagic), and individual movement patterns (spatially resident to long-distance migrations). We genotyped 242 tiger sharks from 10 globally distributed locations at more than 2000 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Although this species often conducts massive distance migrations, the data show strong genetic differentiation at both neutral (FST = 0.125-0.144) and candidate outlier loci (F-ST = 0.570-0.761) between western Atlantic and Indo-Pacific sharks, suggesting the potential for adaptation to the environments specific to these oceanic regions. Within these regions, there was mixed support for population differentiation between northern and southern hemispheres in the western Atlantic, and none for structure within the Indian Ocean. Notably, the results demonstrate a low level of population differentiation of tiger sharks from the remote Hawaiian archipelago compared with sharks from the Indian Ocean (F-ST = 0.003-0.005, P < 0.01). Given concerns about biodiversity loss and marine ecosystem impacts caused by overfishing of oceanic sharks in the midst of rapid environmental change, our results suggest it imperative that international fishery management prioritize conservation of the evolutionary potential of the highly genetically differentiated Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations of this unique apex predator. Furthermore, we suggest targeted management attention to tiger sharks in the Hawaiian archipelago based on a precautionary biodiversity conservation perspective.

Modern, archaeological, and paleontological DNA analysis of a human-harvested marine gastropod (Strombus pugilis) from Caribbean Panama	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES			English	Article						ancient DNA; body size evolution; conch shell; DNA extraction method; reference assembly; whole&#8208; genome sequencing	BOCAS DEL TORO; ANCIENT DNA; MOLLUSK SHELLS; METAGENOMIC ARCHIVES; POPULATION GENOMICS; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; SITIO DRAGO; EXTRACTION; DAMAGE; STRATEGIES	Although protocols exist for the recovery of ancient DNA from land snail and marine bivalve shells, marine conch shells have yet to be studied from a paleogenomic perspective. We first present reference assemblies for both a 623.7 Mbp nuclear genome and a 15.4 kbp mitochondrial genome for Strombus pugilis, the West Indian fighting conch. We next detail a method to extract and sequence DNA from conch shells and apply it to conch from Bocas del Toro, Panama across three time periods: recently-eaten and discarded (n = 3), Late Holocene (984-1258 before present [BP]) archaeological midden (n = 5), and mid-Holocene (5711-7187 BP) paleontological fossil coral reef (n = 5). These results are compared to control DNA extracted from live-caught tissue and fresh shells (n = 5). Using high-throughput sequencing, we were able to obtain S. pugilis nuclear sequence reads from shells across all age periods: up to 92.5 thousand filtered reads per sample in live-caught shell material, 4.57 thousand for modern discarded shells, 12.1 thousand reads for archaeological shells, and 114 reads in paleontological shells. We confirmed authenticity of the ancient DNA recovered from the archaeological and paleontological shells based on 5.7x higher average frequency of deamination-driven misincorporations and 15% shorter average read lengths compared to the modern shells. Reads also mapped to the S. pugilis mitochondrial genome for all but the paleontological shells, with consistent ratios of mitochondrial to nuclear mapped reads across sample types. Our methods can be applied to diverse archaeological sites to facilitate reconstructions of the long-term impacts of human behaviour on mollusc evolutionary biology.

Population Genomic Analyses of the Sea Urchin Echinometra sp. EZ across an Extreme Environmental Gradient	GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Echinometra sp. EZ; Persian/Arabian Gulf; RAD-seq; draft genome assembly; population dynamics; extreme environments	INDO-WEST PACIFIC; GENETIC-VARIATION; BLEACHING EVENT; SPECIATION; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; COMPLETENESS; DIVERGENCE; ADAPTATION; COMPONENT; EVOLUTION	Extreme environmental gradients represent excellent study systems to better understand the variables that mediate patterns of genomic variation between populations. They also allow for more accurate predictions of how future environmental change might affect marine species. The Persian/Arabian Gulf is extreme in both temperature and salinity, whereas the adjacent Gulf of Oman has conditions more typical of tropical oceans. The sea urchin Echinometra sp. EZ inhabits both of these seas and plays a critical role in coral reef health as a grazer and bioeroder, but, to date, there have been no population genomic studies on this or any urchin species in this unique region. E sp. EZ's life history traits (e.g., large population sizes, large reproductive clutches, and long life spans), in theory, should homogenize populations unless nonneutral processes are occurring. Here, we generated a draft genome and a restriction site-associated DNA sequencing data set from seven populations along an environmental gradient across the Persian/Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. The estimated genome size of E. sp. EZ was 609 Mb and the heterozygosity was among the highest recorded for an echinoderm at 4.5%. We recovered 918 high-quality SNPs from 85 individuals which we then used in downstream analyses. Population structure analyses revealed a high degree of admixture between all sites, although there was population differentiation and significant pairwise F-ST values between the two seas. Preliminary results suggest migration is bidirectional between the seas and nine candidate loci were identified as being under putative natural selection, including one collagen gene. This study is the first to investigate the population genomics of a sea urchin from this extreme environmental gradient and is an important contribution to our understanding of the complex spatial patterns that drive genomic divergence.

Going where traditional markers have not gone before: utility of and promise for RAD sequencing in marine invertebrate phylogeography and population genomics	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						balancing selection; estuarine; genome; Nematostella; next-generation sequencing; phylogeography	NEMATOSTELLA-VECTENSIS STEPHENSON; PELAGIC LARVAL DURATION; STARLET SEA-ANEMONE; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; EVOLUTION; POLYMORPHISMS; CONNECTIVITY; PATTERNS; REVEALS; HYPOTHESES	Characterization of large numbers of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout a genome has the power to refine the understanding of population demographic history and to identify genomic regions under selection in natural populations. To this end, population genomic approaches that harness the power of next-generation sequencing to understand the ecology and evolution of marine invertebrates represent a boon to test long-standing questions in marine biology and conservation. We employed restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to identify SNPs in natural populations of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, an emerging cnidarian model with a broad geographic range in estuarine habitats in North and South America, and portions of England. We identified hundreds of SNP-containing tags in thousands of RAD loci from 30 barcoded individuals inhabiting four locations from Nova Scotia to South Carolina. Population genomic analyses using high-confidence SNPs resulted in a highly-resolved phylogeography, a result not achieved in previous studies using traditional markers. Plots of locus-specific FST against heterozygosity suggest that a majority of polymorphic sites are neutral, with a smaller proportion suggesting evidence for balancing selection. Loci inferred to be under balancing selection were mapped to the genome, where 90% were located in gene bodies, indicating potential targets of selection. The results from analyses with and without a reference genome supported similar conclusions, further highlighting RAD-seq as a method that can be efficiently applied to species lacking existing genomic resources. We discuss the utility of RAD-seq approaches in burgeoning Nematostella research as well as in other cnidarian species, particularly corals and jellyfishes, to determine phylogeographic relationships of populations and identify regions of the genome undergoing selection.

Population genomic SNPs from epigenetic RADs: Gaining genetic and epigenetic data from a single established next-generation sequencing approach	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						DNA methylation; genomics; molecular ecology; RADseq; single-nucleotide polymorphism	DNA METHYLATION; PACKAGE; TOOL	Epigenetics is increasingly recognized as an important molecular mechanism underlying phenotypic variation. To study DNA methylation in ecological and evolutionary contexts, epiRADseq is a cost-effective next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique based on reduced representation sequencing of genomic regions surrounding non-/methylated sites. EpiRADseq for genome-wide methylation abundance and ddRADseq for genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping follow very similar library and sequencing protocols, but to date these two types of dataset have been handled separately. Here we test the performance of using epiRADseq data to generate SNPs for population genomic analyses. We tested the robustness of using epiRADseq data for population genomics with two independent datasets: a newly generated single-end dataset for the European whitefish Coregonus lavaretus, and a re-analysis of publicly available, previously published paired-end data on corals. Using standard bioinformatic pipelines with a reference genome and without (i.e. de novo catalogue loci), we compared the number of SNPs retained, population genetic summary statistics and population genetic structure between data drawn from ddRADseq and epiRADseq library preparations. We found that SNPs drawn from epiRADseq are similar in number to those drawn from ddRADseq, with 55%-83% of SNPs being identified by both methods. Genotyping error rate was <5% in both approaches. EpiRADseq-specific allele dropout was low (similar to 1%). For summary statistics, such as heterozygosity and nucleotide diversity, there is a strong correlation between methods (Spearman's rho > 0.88). Furthermore, identical patterns of population genetic structure were recovered using SNPs from epiRADseq and ddRADseq approaches. We show that SNPs obtained from epiRADseq are highly similar to those from ddRADseq and are equivalent for estimating genetic diversity and population structure. This finding is particularly relevant to researchers interested in genetics and epigenetics on the same individuals because using a single epigenomic approach to generate two datasets greatly reduces the time and financial costs compared to using these techniques separately. It also efficiently enables correction of epigenetic estimates with population genetic data. Many studies will benefit from a combinatorial approach with genetic and epigenetic markers and this demonstrates a single, efficient method to do so.
